From social networking sites to professional platforms, profiles act as a digital representation of individuals and entities, which is why web-based profiles are considered ubiquitous. However, the reliability and authenticity of the information displayed on these platforms can often be questionable. This concern becomes particularly significant in critical sectors such as healthcare, recruitment, and other sectors where the credibility of information is paramount.

## Challenges in the Current Landscape

Many online profile platforms amass data from diverse sources to create an individual's or entity's profile. Yet, these platforms primarily focus on collecting and showcasing data, without necessarily ensuring its authenticity. The absence of a robust system to confirm the veracity of this information can result in unreliable profiles. This poses a substantial challenge, especially in environments that require absolute trust, such as clinical trials in healthcare settings. Agencies aiming to employ professionals for crucial roles like principal investigators find it challenging to ascertain the credentials of a potential candidate, rendering the process inefficient and potentially risky.

## Addressing the Authenticity Dilemma

To overcome these challenges, the technology described herein offers a novel approach to track, store, and credential web-based profiles.

The technology under discussion advances web-based profiles through a multi-faceted approach. Initially, computer executable profile information is retrieved and temporarily housed in cloud-based staging repositories. This information then undergoes decomposition into its fundamental data types for meticulous evaluation. The technology further delineates specific fields within a profile, ensuring each associated data component is rigorously scrutinized and validated. After such a thorough process, the profile data is stored in a database. As additional information emerges over time, the technology adeptly maps it to the initial profile, consistently tracking any changes or updates to guarantee the profile's continued authenticity and relevance.

## New Approach for Credentials Management

This innovative technology addresses the long-standing issue of trustworthiness in web-based profiles and by ensuring that data is not just aggregated but also authenticated and tracked over time, the technology enhances the credibility of profiles. Such advancement is particularly important in sectors like healthcare, where the stakes are high, and authenticity is non-negotiable.

The patented technology presented here, centered on networking devices for longitudinal storage of profiles, promises a future where web-based profiles are not just digital representations but trustworthy digital identities.

## Functional Capabilities of the Profile Tracking Technology

The developed technology offers an advanced method for monitoring and identifying changes in computer executable profiles associated with registered entities over a period. Below is a detailed breakdown of its functionalities.

### Profile Retrieval and Staging

The technology retrieves computer executable profile information for registered entities. This profile information encompasses personal data, review details, and aggregated credentialing details derived from multiple credentialing information sources, which once gathered, is staged in cloud repositories.

### Data Processing and Structuring

Post-retrieval, the profile information is segmented into its core data types, representing various fragments of the entire profile. The technology then defines discernible profile fields and associates them with specific profile information components. This structured initial profile data is subsequently stored in a connected database.

### Profile Update and Comparison

After a predetermined interval, the patented technology allows revisiting of the credentialing sources to fetch updated individual credentialing components. It then retrieves a second set of structured profile information based on these fresh components. A critical feature of the technology is its capability to map the initial profile information with this second set, pinpointing any alterations. These changes act as indicators of the evolving reliability of the profile's credentialing over time.

### Notification Mechanism

A particularly user-centric feature is the introduction of computer executable notification rules. One of the notable features of the approach is its adept notification mechanism. It not only proactively triggers notifications in real-time when disparities between the initial and subsequent profile information are discerned but also empowers users. Through their linked computers, users have the flexibility to demand notifications pertaining to profile changes within a designated time frame by simply submitting search queries. This dual functionality ensures users remain informed and can tailor their information intake based on specific needs.

### Crowdsourced Credentialing Index

Building on the change data from profile mapping, the technology formulates a crowdsourced credentialing index for the profile. This index gives insights into the profile's credibility based on longitudinal data.

## Signal Generation and Display

Post the determination of changes, this change data is communicated to the necessary participants. This communication is then dispatched across a network of interlinked communication devices. The technology possesses the capability to transform this communication into pixels, enabling a visual representation. Ultimately, these pixels are showcased on a user device, offering users a timeline view of the profile changes in line with the predefined notification rules.

This advanced technology ensures that stakeholders have a sturdy mechanism to keep track of the credibility and changes in the profiles of registered clinicians, ensuring transparency, reliability, and real-time updates.
