### <span style="font-size:20px">BACKGROUND</span>

Technical Field

The embodiments herein generally relate to data compilation, and more particularly to methods and systems for aggregating ratings data.

Description of the Related Art

Different review platforms often provide different ratings and reviews which may be substantially different based on who is providing the review and based on reliability and authenticity associated with reviewers and reviews. Such platforms leverage the wisdom of a crowd for assessing different entities such as physicians etc. Rating aggregation algorithms exist which typically collate different ratings from such as websites and generate a summation or an average rating for an entity which is indicative of credibility of the entity such as a physician.

Existing methods and systems however do not generally provide an optimal aggregate score since the ratings may be influenced due to variances in reviewers' approach of rating an entity and because all reviews or reviewers may not be reliable in the same way.

In view of the above, there is a need to provide an improved way and system for generating an aggregate rating indicator about an entity to establish an optimal rating and to facilitate searching of entities in an optimal way based on rating indicators to meet user requirements in a precise manner.

The search engine  **304**  may be configured to run a search query for identification of websites that post rating indicators for specific products or services. The search engine  **304**  crawls the Internet and downloads and analyzes sites found on the Internet that contain any type of reviews or ratings associated with a particular category. In an example, the search engine  **304**  may be operatively connected with a search server (not shown) that may include one or more programs for providing searching capabilities and search results processing capabilities. In an example, the search server can include one or more programs that are downloaded and installed to allow the search engine  **304**  to discover and act on information. In an example, the search engine  **304**  may download the program using a known protocol such as HTTP or the file transfer protocol (FTP). Once downloaded, the programs are run by the search engine  **304**  in connection with the search server.

The program allows the search engine  **304**  to perform discrete searches using multiple sources of information that contain reviews and rating indicators. These discrete search capabilities can be coupled with other traditional sources, such as Google™ and Yahoo!™ search engines, for example, to enhance the search experience by the search engine  **304**  and to make sure that the rating indicators and review searches are comprehensively performed throughout the Internet-based information sources. In an example, the search engine  **304**  may be hosted locally with other components of the rating aggregator  **108**. In other embodiments, the search engine  **304**  may be hosted remotely such as by a remote server (e.g., server  **106**  or some other server (not shown)). In such embodiments, the remote server may be linked with individual servers of persons or institutes so as individuals to search for rating indicators and review and submit such rating indicators through a social platform or a user interface to the rating aggregator  **108**. In this manner, distributed individual search experiences and search outputs may be merged along with search capabilities of the search engine  **304**  providing enhanced and comprehensive review and rating aggregation experience to users and viewers of the aggregated rating indicators.

In an example, the search engine  **304**  may further include or be communicatively coupled to a browsing engine (not shown). The browsing engine may be communicatively connected with individual users or viewers or members who are subscribed with a platform provided by the rating aggregator  **108**  or a service provider who maintains the rating aggregator  **108**  through a website, social networking site, rating aggregator platform or through any cloud or non-cloud-based distributed architecture. The browsing engine may be programmed to search the individual's own data storage devices to index the individual's own content so as to explore their views and reviews and rating indicators and merge them with the individual rating indicators during aggregation. These explored reviews and rating indicators are identified for any erroneous and superfluous or fraudulent content or reviews prior to aggregation. The filtering of the rating indicators is discussed below.

In an embodiment herein, the various individual rating indicators identified by the search engine  **304**  are defined in association with the product category they belong to or even a particular object or product or person or institute. For example, the rating indicators may belong to a particular category such as football game review by US citizens. In another aspect, the individual rating indicators may belong to and may be associated with a particular object or product or person or institute for example reviews or rating indicators about a particular physician. In an embodiment, the rating indicators may be numeric in nature. In an embodiment, the rating indicators may be subjective in nature defined in the form of textual, audio, or visual reviews or in the form of a combination of these wherein a sentiment analysis may be needed as will be discussed below.

The filtering engine  **306**  is configured to filter out the superfluous, erroneous, or fraudulent rating indicators (hereinafter referred to as erroneous rating indicators together interchangeably for the purpose of simplicity of description) from a set of identified individual or discrete rating indicators as identified by the search engine  **304**. In an embodiment, the filtering engine  **306**  may be configured to filter the individual rating indicators based on frequency of rating of an entity by a person. For example, if a person provides a rating to an entity too frequently, the rating indicator may be considered as erroneous and not trustworthy. In such a case, the trust and reliability associated with the rating indicator may be considered as low. On the contrary, if the frequency of rating of an entity by a person is moderate or low, it may be considered as trustworthy and reliable. Such a rating indicator may not be considered as erroneous.

In an aspect of the embodiments herein, the filtering engine  **306**  may be configured to filter the individual rating indicators based on quantity of rating of a rated entity by a rating entity. For example, if the same person (or rating entity) rates the same rated entity multiple times from different websites or from different publishers, the rating indicator may be considered as erroneous. In such as case, the filtering engine  **306**  may either remove the redundant rating indicator or may altogether consider the rating indicator as erroneous. For example, in one case, if the same rating entity rates the same rated entity twenty times from twenty different websites, the filtering engine  **306**  may consider these twenty rating indicators equal to only one rating indicator and the remaining nineteen rating indicators may be considered as erroneous and filtered out during aggregation. In another case, the rating indicator by such a rating entity may altogether be considered as not trustworthy and unreliable and such rating indicators by any such person are completely moved out of the aggregation process by the filtering engine  **306**  and are not considered at all. In some embodiments, trust and reliability indices may be associated with individual rating indicators such that aggregated rating indicators with at least a defined threshold level of indices only are considered for aggregation.

In an aspect of the embodiments herein, the filtering engine  **306**  may be configured to filter the individual rating indicator based on spatial coordinates such as geographical locations. For example, if a person based in Texas, USA rates a physician located in the UK, the associated rating indicator may be considered as erroneous. In an aspect of the embodiments herein, the filtering engine  **306**  may be configured to filter the individual rating indicators based on gender identification. For example, if a male person rates a gynecologist, it may be considered as fraudulent or erroneous and may be filtered out during the rating aggregation process. In an aspect of the embodiments herein, the filtering engine  **306**  may be configured to filter the individual rating indicators based on age specific information associated with the rating entity who rates the rated entity.

The rating evaluation unit  **308**  may be configured to process the individual rating indicators obtained after filtering out of the superfluous and erroneous rating indicators. In an aspect, the processing may involve performing a simple averaging or weighted averaging of the individual rating indicators. In an aspect, the processing may involve summation of the individual rating indicators. In still another aspect, the processing may involve calculating mean of the individual rating indicators. In an aspect, the processing may involve various other algorithms or statistical and analytical tools such as calculating standard deviation etc. for the individual rating indicators. The processing of the individual rating indicators by the rating evaluation unit  **308**  results in an evaluated or aggregated rating indicator that is a representation of the individual rating indicators taken together without any erroneous effect caused due to erroneous and superfluous rating indicators.

The rating evaluation unit  **308**  further associates a comparative rank to various aggregated rating indicators in a defined category of rated entities. For example, after determining the aggregated rating indicators for a group of physicians in California, USA, the rating evaluation unit  **308**  may further associate a comparative rank with each of the aggregated rating indicators corresponding to rated entities that are indicative of which physician or rated entity is rated higher or lower relatively in the defined category.

The publishing engine  **310**  may be configured to receive the aggregated rating indicator and/or the relative rank of the rated entity within the category of ratings and publish the rating indicator on a website or any other portal such as associated with any of the publishers  **202**  or any other publisher. In an aspect of the embodiments herein, the aggregated rating indicator may be published on a social networking website. In an aspect of the embodiments herein, the aggregated rating indicator may be published by any other review website. In another aspect of the embodiments herein, the rating aggregator  **108**  may be communicatively linked with one or more of the publishers  **202**  to depict the aggregated rating indicator along with the individual ratings as published by the publishers  **202**  on the same page so as viewers to compare a local individual rating indicator on a website and a corresponding aggregated rating indicator. In an aspect of the embodiments herein, the server  **106** , operatively connected to the rating aggregator  **106** , may separately host a website on its own to publish the aggregated rating indicator independently.

In accordance with various embodiments herein, various ways of depicting or publishing the aggregated rating indicator may be employed by the publishing engine  **310**. For example, in an aspect of the embodiments herein, a visual or a graphical interface displaying the aggregated rating indicator may be provided. For example, a custom chart such as a bar chart and the like may be used to display the aggregated rating indicator.

In an aspect of the embodiments herein, the publishing engine  **310**  may display a user interface sectioned into two separate portions. Individual rating indicators may be displayed on one side of the interface in one portion while a respective aggregated rating indicator is displayed in another portion of the section or interface. For example, on a right side of the interface, there may be thirty rating indicators taken from individual websites while a right side of the interface may include only one rating indicator that is an aggregated rating indicator corresponding to the thirty individual rating indicators.

In an aspect of the embodiments herein, the aggregated ratings may be defined in the form of positive or negative ratings. In an aspect of the embodiments herein, the aggregated ratings and the individual ratings may simultaneously be displayed on a user interface such as in the form of numerator and denominator combinations, and the like. In accordance with other embodiments, several other types of depictions, displays, and visuals may be used to publish the aggregated ratings. The published aggregated ratings may be linked to a customizable user interface (not shown) that can be customized by a user or viewer of a page or website containing the published aggregated ratings.

The memory circuit  **312**  may be communicatively connected with the search engine  **304**  to store the individual rating indicators gathered by the search engine  **304**. The memory circuit  **312**  may be further connected communicatively with the filtering engine  **306**  to store details about the erroneous rating indicators that are filtered out. The memory circuit  **312**  may be further connected with the rating evaluation unit  **308**  to store details about the aggregated rating indicator. In an embodiment herein, the memory circuit  **312**  may store the aggregated rating indicator in association with details about a category to which it belongs to such as for example, physicians, movies, actors, and the like.

In accordance with an embodiment herein, the rating aggregator  **108**  may include the communication circuit  **302**. The communication circuit  **302**  may, for example, notify a person or any other rated entity who is rated by others such as rating entities prior to aggregation of respective individual rating indicators so as to confirm if the individual rating indicators are appropriate. The communication circuit  **302**  may also send details about such person who rates the rated entity. The confirmation from the person can be received by the communication circuit  **302**  which may be indicative of a negative response or a positive response such that a negative response represents that the rated entity does not recognize the rating person who rates him and there is a lesser chance that the rating is appropriate. In an aspect of the embodiments herein, such a rating may be considered erroneous which may be filtered out by the filtering engine  **306**. The communication circuit  **302**  may further serve as a communication channel between various other components of the rating aggregator  **108**  and other external sources such as an entity who is rated (rated entity), persons or groups who rate an entity (rating entity), and other interested parties who are interested in knowing reviews and comments offered to such entities, etc. In an embodiment herein, the communication circuit  **302**  may be coupled to the user interface that is finally viewed by viewers or users and may provide an interactive platform for information exchange among the users or viewers and the rating aggregator  **108**  through the user interface.

In an example, the embodiments herein provide a mechanism wherein rated entities for whom aggregated rating indicators are generated may be compared with one another automatically based on their respective aggregated rating indicators. For example, in a group of physicians, it may be identified as to who is the best physician and so on by comparing the respective aggregated rating indicators.

The embodiments herein provide a mechanism wherein similar rated entities may be identified based on their aggregated rating indicators within defined constraints. The defined constraints may, for example, comprise age, geographical location, gender, specialty, and the like. For example, in an aspect of the embodiments herein, similar doctors may be identified in a geographical area based on aggregated scores of doctors in the geographical area. In such a case, if a doctor is busy and cannot take a patient, one can search for another doctor by similarity in specialty or other constraint based on their aggregated rating indicators. In an aspect, the embodiments herein may allow associating similarity indices for a group of rated entities who are considered for rating aggregation.

FIG. 4, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 3, illustrates an example of the rating aggregator  **108** , in accordance with an embodiment herein. As shown, the rating aggregator  **108**  includes all of the components as shown in FIG. 3. The rating aggregator  **108**  further includes a sentiment analysis engine  **402**  in addition to the components already discussed in conjunction with FIG. 3.

The sentiment analysis engine  **402**  is configured to perform a set of analytical operations for analysis of opinions, textual information, sentiments and emotions, and other expressions. The analysis may involve identification of orientation of views, reviews and ratings from textual information containing emotions, or sentiments as indicators of reviews and ratings. In an aspect of the embodiments herein, the sentiment analysis engine  **402**  converts such subjective expressions and reviews into ratings for use by the filtering engine  **306**  and rating evaluation unit  **308**  to determine an aggregate rating indicator. In accordance with the embodiments herein, the sentiment analysis engine  **402**  facilitates in providing a capability for associating rating indicators with textual information and subjective expressions and further analysis of these rating indicators. In an aspect of the embodiments herein, prior to sentiment analysis by the sentiment analysis engine  **402** , the views may be either converted into numerical scores or ratings or in the form of negative, positive, or neutral ratings by the sentiment analysis engine  **402**. For example, a patient may post subjective reviews about a physician on a website. These subjective reviews are analyzed by the sentiment analysis engine  **402**  to associate a rating indicator with the physician based on the patient judgment. Based on the analysis, the rating indicator is associated by the sentiment analysis engine  **402**  such that it is indicative of a score of the physician earned from the patient judgment and review. The rating indicator is then used by the filtering engine  **306**  to perform the filtering tasks as discussed above after which the erroneous rating indicator is moved out of consideration by the rating evaluation unit  **308**  while calculating an aggregated rating for the physician.

FIG. 5 through FIG. 7, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 4, are examples of user interfaces  **500** ,  **600** ,  **700** , respectively, of the rating aggregator  **108** , in accordance with some embodiments herein. The user interfaces  **500** ,  **600** ,  **700**  provide a mechanism for users to interact with the rating aggregator  **108**  for rating or review interactions.

Several embodiments are further described below.

In an embodiment herein, a genuineness score may be attached to the aggregated rating indicator or individual rating indicator and also to the rated entity who provides an individual rating indicator. The genuineness score may be calculated by analyzing one or more attributes of the review and the aggregated rating indicator and the rated entity. Some of the parameters or attributes that may be considered for calculating the genuineness score may include, without limitations, the number of reviews, locations, gender, verification of a patient, individual review source site, writing style, and duration of time within which reviews and individual ratings are performed, etc.

In an embodiment herein, a review site that provides reviews or ratings from authenticated users may rank higher than a review site that allows anonymous reviews and ratings. In an embodiment herein, a set of user interfaces may be provided for mobile applications that may allow interactions of a user with the rating aggregator  **108**  through a mobile device (not shown). In an example, the set of user interfaces may be executed through widgets on the mobile device. In an embodiment herein, the rating aggregator  **108**  allows taking of a physician's name, and looking up the information on all defined physician ratings and review sites, presenting a combined output that puts together the individual; ratings, comments, reviews, etc. from the various sites and collate them in a single page that may include the aggregated rating indicator.

In an embodiment herein, the rating aggregator  **108**  may raise flags that are indicative of frauds by specific physicians. In an embodiment herein, the rating aggregator  **108**  may raise flags that are indicative of conflicts between a physician and a third party. In an embodiment herein, the rating aggregator  **108**  may be integrated within a healthcare service provider setup so as to integrate reviews and ratings for physicians by filtering out superfluous ratings thereby facilitating in presenting credentialed or authenticated or aggregated rating indicators to users or patients or other rated entities.

In accordance with an embodiment herein, the rating aggregator  **108**  may be communicatively coupled with external systems (not shown) associated with insurance agencies or other third parties so as to retrieve financial information. The rating aggregator  **108**  may further be communicatively coupled to rating sites or individual profiles including social profiles associated with social networking services or social networking systems so as to retrieve doctors' or physicians' profile information. The financial information retrieved from the insurance agencies and the profile information may together be integrated so as to generate a comparative structure of physicians performing various procedures and their respective billings to the insurance agencies. An output generated by the comparative analysis yields yet another parameter referred to as financials parameter to be considered during aggregation by the rating aggregator  **108**  for associating a comparative aggregated rating with a physician. Referring to FIGS. 8A and 8B now, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 7, two diagrams  **801** ,  **802**  are depicted corresponding to two doctors. As evident, the second doctor (Dr. Mike) performs more procedures and therefore total billings to the insurance agency (in this case Medicare) would be more in case of the second doctor as compared to the first doctor (Dr. Al). Further, the second doctor performs even more types of procedures. The second doctor sees more patients than the first doctor. The output of the comparative analysis of the information such as the one shown in the FIGS. 8A and 8B that is retrieved by the rating aggregator  **108**  from the insurance agency and the profiles of the physicians or doctors may be used as one of several parameters considered by the rating aggregator  **108**  for evaluating aggregated rating indicators of each of the two doctors.

FIG. 9, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 8B, illustrates an example of the sentiment analysis engine  **402** , rating evaluation unit  **308**  and the filtering engine  **306**  communicatively or operatively coupled with one another to perform various rating aggregation tasks. As depicted, the sentiment analysis engine  **402**  may include a sentiment analysis application  **902** , a database  **904** , business logic  **906** , a sentiment lexicon  **908** , machine learning tools  **910** , a polarity classifier  **912** , a transcript writer  **914** , a context mapping engine  **916** , APIs  **918** , heuristics  **920** , and a sentiment score processing circuit  **922**.

The sentiment analysis application  **902**  may be configured to execute sentiment processing tasks with the use of specific software and hardware combinations so that the sentiment analysis application  **902**  may be initiated to execute a set of tasks for analyzing sentiment-based ratings including reviews, comments, and the like that are indicative of ratings provided by the rating entity for the rated entity. The sentiment analysis application  **902**  may be configured to read expressions and emoticons and various other types of sentiments. The sentiment analysis application  **902**  may be run by an application specific processing component or processor configured to perform sentiment analysis of sentiment-based ratings. The sentiment analysis application  **902**  may utilize a set of other APIs  **918**  to facilitate execution of specific applications. The database  **904**  may store defined rules for sentiment analysis. For example, the database  **904**  may store various emoticons, sentiments or other expression forms that may be used to provide a rating by the rating entity. The sentiment lexicon  **908**  may further be integrated or communicatively connected with the database  **904**. The sentiment lexicon  **908**  may store text-based information or dictionary rules or vocabulary that may be used by the rating entity for providing a sentiment-based rating involving use of specific words or text or phrases which may be stored by the sentiment lexicon  **908**. The sentiment lexicon  **908**  and the database  **904**  may together store information pertinent to expressions or vocabulary etc. which may be compared with the words, expressions, etc. occurring in the sentiment score component of the rating indicator to perform sentiment analysis of the sentiment score component of the rating indicator.

The sentiment analysis application  **902**  may utilize information contained in the database  **904** , sentiment lexicon  **908** , and the business logic  **906** , and may apply heuristics  **920**  and the machine learning tools to perform the analysis of the sentiment score component. The sentiment analysis application  **902**  may further retrieve polarity indices or polarity identifiers indicative of positive and negative polarities or expressions generated and classified by the polarity classifier  **912**. The polarity classifier  **912**  may classify various expressions in either a positive expression or a negative expression to associate a polarity to the sentiment score component such that the classified expressions may be used by the sentiment analysis engine  **402**  to perform sentiment analysis for polarity related expressions. The sentiment analysis application  **902**  may further associate a context value to the sentiment score component during sentiment analysis of the sentiment score component so that each sentiment score component is analyzed in view of the context in which sentiments are provided by the rating entity for the rated entity in the form of the sentiment score component of the rating indicator. The transcript writer  **914**  may generate transcripts for audio or video reviews or comments so that the sentiment analysis application  **902**  may use the transcripts for performing sentiment analysis.

The sentiment score processing circuit  **922**  may run the sentiment analysis application  **902**  and determine a score in the form of a numerical value or in any other form such that the score is representative of the sentiment score component. The sentiment processing circuit  **922**  may therefore, in an embodiment, create a score component that may not be sentiment-based but represents the sentiment score component through values or rating indicators that may be aggregated with the numerical score component through statistical tools after filtering of the erroneous or fraudulent rating indicators.

The sentiment analysis engine  **402**  may perform analysis on the plurality rating indicators that may include numerical components as well as sentiment score components such that the sentiment score components may be processed by the sentiment analysis engine  **402**  in a way that the scores determined based on and representative of the sentiment score components may be easily aggregated with the numerical score components to determine aggregate rating indicators. The plurality of rating indicators may be retrieved from various sources such as a local storage component  **924** , a first web-based repository  **926** , and a second web-based repository  **928**.

The local storage component  **924**  may be associated with a personal storage device of the rating entity such as a personal computer or a personal computing machine such that the sentiment analysis engine  **402**  may access the local storage component  **924**  remotely to access a localized numerical score component  **930**  and a localized sentiment score component  **932**. The localized numerical score component  **930**  signifies numerical ratings provided by the rated entity and stored on the local or personal storage device. The localized numerical score component  **930**  may not be publicly published on a web or any other networked platform accessible by general public for reasons of privacy and to keep the published ratings anonymous, in an example. The localized sentiment score component  **932**  signifies sentiment-based ratings such as reviews, comments, feedback etc. provided by the rated entity and stored on the local or personal storage device. The localized sentiment score component  **932**  may not be publicly published on a web or any other networked platform accessible by general public for reasons of privacy and to keep the published ratings anonymous, in an example. The localized numerical score component  **930**  and the localized sentiment score component  **932**  may be accessed by the sentiment analysis engine  **402**  upon authorization by the rated entity such that the sentiment analysis engine  **402**  may privately access the local storage component  **924**  to retrieve the localized numerical score component  **930**  and the localized sentiment score component  **932**. In an example, the context mapping engine  **916**  of the sentiment analysis engine  **402**  may perform the sentiment analysis of the localized sentiment score component  **932**  based on the localized numerical score component  **930**  such that the localized numerical score component  **930**  may influence analysis of the localized sentiment score component  **932**.

The sentiment analysis engine  **402**  may access the first web-based repository  **926**  that may be publicly available through a web-based interface or any other such interface. The first web-based repository  **926**  may store a numerical score component  **934**  and a sentiment score component  **936**. The numerical score component  **934**  signifies numerical ratings provided by the rated entity and stored on the first web-based repository  **926**  which may be public. The sentiment score component  **936**  signifies sentiment-based ratings such as reviews, comments, feedback etc. provided by the rated entity and stored on the first web-based repository  **926**. The numerical score component  **934**  and the sentiment score component  **936**  may be accessed by the sentiment analysis engine  **402**  for performing sentiment analysis of the sentiment score component  **936**. In an example, the context mapping engine  **916**  may perform the sentiment analysis of the sentiment score component  **936**  based on the numerical score component  **934**  such that the numerical score component  **934**  may influence analysis of the sentiment score component  **936**.

The sentiment analysis engine  **402**  may access the second web-based repository  **928**  which may be publicly accessible by a social connection over a social network. The second web-based repository  **928**  may store a profile component  **938**  over a social platform hosted by the social network such that the profile component  **938**  may be accessible by the sentiment analysis engine  **402**  through a social engine  **940**  associated with the social networking platform with dynamically changing user connections. The profile component  **938**  may include a computer executable profile of the rated entity generated by the rating entity and accessible through the social engine  **940**. The sentiment analysis engine  **402**  may further access a billing component  **942**. The billing component  **942**  may include financial and billing information generated and verified by a third party computing system  **944**  such that the profile component  **938**  and the billing component  **942**  include a combination of sentiments, natural texts, numerical scores, and other numerical data. The aggregation of the plurality of discrete ratings may depend on several factors as discussed elsewhere in the document. In an embodiment, the aggregation may depend on a comparison output obtained from comparison of the profile component  **938**  and the billing component  **942**  of the rated entity. A higher weight may be associated during aggregation if the profile component  **938**  matches with the billing component  **942**  substantially which may be indicative that the profile of the rated entity is reliable based on ratings provided by the rated entity as well as billing information disclosed to third parties such as tax authorities and the like.

In an example, the social networking platform or the social engine  **940**  may allow dynamically changing connections wherein the rating entity and the rated entity may be one such dynamic changing connections. The social networking platform or the social engine  **940**  herein may refer to a socially networked engine or portal allowing access to a crowd of persons or computers as network connections whose identity and profile and social relationships among one another changes dynamically over time. These dynamically changing connections may access the social engine  **940**  through registered social profiles. The social engine  **940**  may allow users (who are registered as dynamic connections) to sign up and communicate with their friends, peers, colleagues, coworkers or other individuals they share some common interest with. These connections are made through requests and most commonly must be mutually accepted before certain functionality is allowed between two or more individuals. The connections provide the ability to the users to share content amongst and between them enabled through social networking applications.

In an example, various numerical ratings and numerical score components may be directly submitted to the filtering engine  **306**  while various sentiment-based ratings or sentiment score components may be submitted to the sentiment analysis engine  **402**  which may upon sentiment analysis be accessed by the filtering engine  **306**. The filtering engine  **306**  may collate the sentiment score components  **932**  and  **936**  and the numerical score components  **930**  and  **934**  for performing ratings filtering tasks such as to remove erroneous or fraudulent ratings prior to aggregation to determine the aggregate score.

The filtering engine  **306**  may include a geographical (geo) location coordinate analysis engine  **946** , a gender mapping engine  **948** , a writing style analysis engine  **950** , a duplicate ratings analysis engine  **952** , age mapping engine  **954** , a rating frequency analysis engine  **956** , a rating duration analysis engine  **958** , and a rating sources analysis engine  **960**.

In an example, the geo-location coordinate analysis engine  **946**  may retrieve geo-location coordinate information of the rated entity and the rating entity and compare the two locations. Based on the comparison, the geo-location coordinate analysis engine  **946**  may identify geographical proximity of the rating entity and the rated entity. A predefined threshold may be defined such that if the geographical proximity is more than the threshold, the rating indicator may be considered erroneous signifying a possibility of fraud because the rating entity is located far from the rated entity and there are fewer chances that the rated entity would have interacted with the rating entity.

In an example, the gender mapping engine  **948**  may retrieve gender specific information of the rated entity and the rating entity. Based on predefined criteria, the filtering engine  **306**  may consider a rating indicator as erroneous depending on an output generated by the gender mapping engine  **948**. For example, if the rated entity is a doctor for gynecology treatments and if the rating entity is a male person, the rating indicator provided by the rating entity may be considered erroneous depending on the predefined criteria.

In an example, the writing style analysis engine  **950**  may compare writing style of the reviews and the comments written by the rating entity with pre stored writing style of the rating entity. Based on the comparison, the rating indicator may be determined as erroneous or not during filtering by the filtering engine  **306**. For example, if the writing style matches with the pre-stored writing style of the rating entity, the rating indicator may be considered as valid and otherwise the rating indicator may be considered as erroneous.

In an example, the duplicate ratings analysis engine  **952**  may be configured to identify multiple rating indicators originating from the same rating entity and for the same rated entity. The filtering engine  **306**  may remove all such duplicate rating indicators or may altogether consider such rating indicators as erroneous.

In an example, the age mapping engine  **954**  may determine age of the rating entity from profile information of the rating entity such that if the age of the rating entity meets predefined criteria such as falls within a defined range or beyond a defined range, the rating indicator may be considered erroneous. The predefined criteria may be dependent on the age and other characteristics associated with the rated entity.

The rating frequency analysis engine  **956**  may determine frequency with which ratings or rating indicators are provided by the rating entity for the rated entity. A predefined threshold may be associated such that if the determined frequency is more than the predefined threshold, the rating indicator may be considered as erroneous. The filtering engine  **306**  may remove such erroneous rating indicators.

The rating duration analysis engine  **958**  may determine duration between subsequent rating indicators by the rating entity for the rated entity. A predefined threshold may be associated such that if the determined duration is less than the predefined threshold, the rating indicator may be considered as erroneous. The filtering engine  **306**  may remove such erroneous rating indicators.

In an example, the rating sources analysis engine  **960**  may identify sources from where the rating entity submits the rating indicators such as a personal social networking page, a specific website and the like. The filtering engine  **306**  may consider a rating indicator as erroneous based on certain predefined rules in connection with the rating sources. The filtering engine  **306**  may consider the rating indicator as erroneous based on the rating sources as specified by the predefined rules.

An output generated by each of the geo-location coordinate analysis engine  **946** , gender mapping engine  **948** , writing style analysis engine  **950** , duplicate ratings analysis engine  **952** , age mapping engine  **954** , rating frequency analysis engine  **956** , rating duration analysis engine  **958** , and the rating sources analysis engine  **960**  may be used by a filter circuit  **962**  which may perform specific processing tasks to filter the erroneous rating indicator based on predefined rules. The filter circuit  **962**  may include or be coupled to a processor with hardware components specifically designed and configured to perform application specific tasks.

In an example, the filtering engine  **306**  may be coupled with a trust and reliability index calculator  **964**. The trust and reliability index calculator  **964**  may be configured to determine a trust level and a reliability index associated with the rating entity such that the trust level and the reliability index may be determined based on reputation and a historical rating profile of the rating entity. The trust and reliability index may be used by the filter circuit  **962**  as a parameter to authenticate and filter the erroneous rating indicator. The lesser the trust level and reliability index associated with the rating entity, the higher are the chances of the rating indicator submitted by the rating entity to be erroneous and fraud. The historical rating profile of the rating entity may be indicative of rating behavior of the rating entity for rating a plurality of entities other than the rated entity. In an example, historical rating profiles of several other rating entities may be generated and the historical rating profile may be compared with the historical rating profiles of the several other entities to generate a comparison output. The rating indicator associated with the rating entity may be considered as the erroneous rating indicator based on the comparison output in an example. For example, if the rating behavior as identified based on the historical rating profile varies from an average rating behavior as identified from the several historical rating profiles of several other entities, the rating indicator may be considered as erroneous by the filtering engine  **306**  and may be removed before performing aggregation. In an example, a baseline rating behavior may be associated with a defined range based on the historical rating profiles of the several other entities such that if the rating behavior of the rating entity is beyond the range, the rating indicator may be considered as erroneous. The rating behavior may be defined in the form of numerical components with the use of various APIs, automated algorithms and semantic intelligence tools.

The rating evaluation unit or rating evaluation engine  **308**  may include aggregation rules  **966** , an aggregation engine  **968** , an aggregate rating comparator  **970** , a relevancy identification engine  **972** , and a presentation tier  **974**. The aggregation rules  **966**  may be defined to control aggregation tasks such that different combination ways may be used to generate the aggregate rating indicator based on the plurality of individual rating indicators. The aggregation engine  **968**  may generate the aggregate rating indicator based on the aggregation rules  **966**.

In an example, a rating indicator category may be associated with a rated entity. For example, a first aggregate rating indicator may be established for a first rated entity based on a plurality of individual rating indicators for the first rated entity. A second aggregate rating indicator may be established for a second rated entity based on a plurality of individual rating indicators for the second rated entity. The first rated entity and the second rated entity may belong to the same rating category. The aggregate rating comparator  **970**  may compare the first aggregate rating and the second aggregate rating. The relevancy identification engine  **972**  may identify a relevant identity from among the first entity and the second entity based on a user request submitted to the rating aggregator  **108**. The user may specify relevancy details such as location of a relevant entity, time of availability at a particular time, geographical proximity of the relevant entity from a specific location, based on trust scores and reliability indices associated with the relevant entity, and the like such that the relevancy identification engine  **972**  may identify the relevant identity which matches with the user provided details for the relevant entity. In an example, multiple entities may be identified that may match with the user details. The user may in such case select an entity that best matches the user provided details. In case the entity is not available, an alternative entity may be identified from among the multiple entities. For example, the first entity and the second entity may be physicians and the user may want to select the best physician for appointment based on their aggregated rating indicators. The user may select the first entity for example. However, an alternative entity such as the second entity may be selected based on availability at a particular time, based on availability at a particular location, based on geographical proximity from a specific location, and based on comparison of trust scores and reliability indices associated with the first entity and the second entity. In an example, if the first entity is not available, the second entity may be shortlisted.

The presentation tier  **974**  may be configured to generate an output for presentation on a display unit. The presentation tier  **974**  may for example publish the first aggregate rating and the second aggregate rating on the display unit such as a website and the like.

FIG. 10, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 9, illustrates a method diagram for publishing the aggregate rating indicator based on the plurality of discrete rating indicators associated with the rated entity. In an example, the plurality of discrete rating indicators may include a first rating indicator, a second rating indicator, and a third rating indicator. In various examples, there can be even more or less number of rating indicators associated with the rated entity. The method may include searching a plurality of repositories such as web hosted repositories or other storage devices containing the plurality of discrete rating indicators associated with the rated entity. In an example, each of the plurality of rating indicators may include a numerical score component and a sentiment score component. The numerical score component may include numerical-based rating indicators and the sentiment score component may include non-numerical based rating indicators which may include identifiers of expressions, emoticons, emotions, and the like sentiments.

The method may include retrieving the first rating indicator from a first repository at step  **1002**. The first rating indicator may include a first numerical score component and a first semantic score component. The method may include retrieving the second rating indicator from a second repository at step  **1004**. The second rating indicator may include a second numeric score component and a second semantic score component. The method may include retrieving the third rating indicator from a third repository at step  **1006**. The third rating indicator may include a third numeric score component and a third semantic score component. The first rating indicator, the second rating indicator, and the third rating indicator may be stored in the memory circuit  **312**  which may be equipped with a special purpose processor such as the special purpose processor  **116**  configured and designed to perform application specific tasks. In various examples, the first rating indicator, the second rating indicator, and the third rating indicator may be retrieved from the plurality of repositories such that the plurality of repositories may include a web-based repository, a social networking engine or a personalized social networking platform section, a healthcare rating indicator agency information source, a local storage unit component or individual local storage component associated with the rated entity or a rating entity, and the like. The individual local storage components may reside on a local computing machine communicatively connected with the special purpose processor  **116**  through a server component or the server  **106**. The method may include, in an embodiment, searching the individual local storage components such as the local storage component  **924**  for a rating indicator provided by an individual to the rated entity. The rating indicator may reside in the local storage components and may include a sentiment score component including sentiments, reviews, comments, and views, and a numerical score component. The special purpose processor  **116**  may index the rating indicator in the memory circuit  **312**.

The method may include performing filtering operations to filter out an erroneous or fraudulent rating indicator from among the first rating indicator, the second rating indicator, and the third rating indicator at step  **1008**. The filtering may be processed by the special purpose processor  **116**  coupled with or including the filtering engine  **306**  such that the special purpose processor  **116**  filters the erroneous or fraudulent rating indicator based on a combination of parameters that have been discussed elsewhere in the document. The parameters may include for example a geo-location coordinate similarity between the rating entity and the rated entity, gender identification, age specifics, frequency of submitting rating indicators for the rated entity by the rating entity, sentiment writing style, duration between subsequent rating indicators by the same rating entity for the same rated entity, duplicate rating indicators provided by the rating entity for the rated entity, use of multiple different rating sources for rating the rated entity by the rating entity, and the like.

At step  **1010** , the method may include aggregating the first rating indicator, the second rating indicator, and the third rating indicator by the special purpose processor  **116**  after filtering out the fraudulent or erroneous rating indicator such that the aggregation results in the aggregate rating indicator indicative of an equivalent of the plurality of discrete rating indicators other than the fraudulent rating indicator.

The method may include generating an electric signal comprising data signifying the aggregate rating indicator and the rated entity at step  **1012**. At step  **1014** , the electric signal may be transmitted from a first computing device  **1102**  a (shown in FIG. 11), which may be communicatively and operatively coupled to the special purpose processor  **116** , to a second computing device  **1102**  b. The first computing device  **1102**  a and the second computing device  **1102**  b may be connected over the network  **104**  with a plurality of communicatively linked data communication devices  **1102**  a ,  **1102**  b,  **1102**  c , and  **1102**  d  (together referred to as  **1102** ). In an example, the plurality of computing devices  **1102**  may be associated and connected with various publishers  **202**. At step  **1016** , the method may include converting the electric signal into a plurality of pixels. The plurality of pixels may be displayed on a display unit of the second communication device  **1102**  b at step  **1018**  to publish the aggregate rating indicator associated with the rated entity and the data signifying the rated entity. FIG. 11, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 10, illustrates an exemplary architecture involving the plurality of computing devices  **1102**  connected over the network  **104**. The first computing device  **1102**  a may be associated with the rating aggregator  **108**. Other computing devices of the plurality of computing devices  **1102**  may be associated with the publishers  **202**  from where rating indicators may be retrieved or aggregate rating indicators may be published or displayed.

In an embodiment, the rating indicator category may be associated with the rated entity. The aggregate score is determined for the plurality of discrete rating indicators such that each of the plurality of discrete rating indicators may be linked to the same category. The method may also include determining a trust score, and a reliability index for the first rating indicator, the second rating indicator, and the third rating indicator. The first rating indicator, the second rating indicator, and the third rating indicator may qualify for the aggregation when the trust score and the reliability index exceeds a threshold trust score and a threshold reliability score for a specific rating indicator category identified by a rating indicator category identifier maintained by the memory circuit  **312**. The rating indicator category identifier may be used to determine and identify the category to which the rated entity belongs to. The rating identifier may for example be associated to signify a physician category or a healthcare category or a finance category, and the like. Different rating indicator categories may be defined with different threshold values of the trust score and the reliability index such that a dynamic trust score and a dynamic reliability index may be associated with the rating indicator category identifiable by the rating indicator category identifier.

In an example, the first rating indicator, the second rating indicator, and the third rating indicator may be associated with a first rated entity such that the aggregate rating indicator identified from the first rating indicator, the second rating indicator, and the third rating indicator may be a first rating indicator associated with the first rated entity. The first aggregate rating indicator may be associated with a first category such that the first rating indicator, the second rating indicator, and the third rating indicator are associated for the same first rating indicator category. The method may further include retrieving a fourth rating indicator category, a fifth rating indicator category, and a sixth rating indicator category associated with a second rated entity for the same rating indicator category identified by the rating indicator category identifier. The method may include filtering out a fraudulent or erroneous rating indicator from among the fourth rating indicator, the fifth rating indicator and the sixth rating indicator by the special purpose processor  **116**  such that the fraudulent rating indicator is determined by the special purpose processor  **116**  based on the combination of the parameters as discussed earlier. The fourth rating indicator, the fifth rating indicator, and the sixth rating indicator may be aggregated after filtering out the fraudulent or erroneous rating indicator such that the aggregation results in a second aggregate rating indicator associated with the second rated entity. The method may include comparing the first aggregate rating indicator and the second aggregate rating indicator. The method may include identifying a relevant entity from among the first entity and the second entity based on a user query such that the relevant entity may be identified based on availability at a particular time, based on availability at a particular location, based on geographical proximity from a specific location, and based on comparison of trust scores and reliability indices associated with the first entity and the second entity. The determination of the relevant entity is already discussed above.

In an example, the electric signal may include data signifying the relevant entity and a relevant entity profile such that when the electric signal is transmitted to the second computing device, the data pertinent to the relevant entity and the relevant entity profile may be displayed on the second computing device  **1102**  b. The plurality of pixels may be displayed on the display unit of the second communication device  **1102**  b to publish the data signifying the relevant entity and the relevant entity profile.

In an example, the profile component  **938**  as discussed earlier may be generated for the rated entity by the rating entity. The profile component  **938**  may include a computer executable profile of the rated entity which may be stored at and accessible through the social networking platform associated with the rated entity through the social networking engine or social engine  **940**. The social networking engine  **940**  may allow dynamically changing user connections including the rating entity and rated entity as dynamically changing user connections among other such connections. The profile component  **938**  may be accessed by the aggregation engine  **968**  and/or the filtering engine  **306**  upon authorization by the rated entity. The aggregation engine  **968**  may further retrieve the billing component  **942**  for the rated entity hosted by the third party computing system  **944**. The billing component  **942**  may include a billing profile including financial and billing information generated and verified by the third party computing system  **944**. The billing component  **942**  and the profile component  **938**  may include a combination of sentiments, natural texts, numerical scores, and other numerical data. The method may include comparing the billing component  **942**  and the profile component  **938**  such that a comparison output may be used as a parameter for aggregating the plurality of discrete rating indicators.

The plurality of individual or discrete rating indicators may be defined in the form of an audio review, a video review, or a visual review. The method may include normalizing the rating indicators to a predefined format by the special purpose processor  **116**  so that the aggregate rating indicator may be determined.

In an example, the historical rating profile of the rating entity may be created that is indicative of rating behavior of the rated entity for rating of a plurality of other entities. The method may include creating historical rating profiles of a plurality of other rating entities other than the rating entity. The method may include comparing the historical rating profile of the rating entity with the historical rating profiles of the plurality of other rating entities to generate a comparison output. The comparison output may be used by the filtering engine  **306**  to determine the erroneous or fraudulent rating indicator. For example, a rating indicator such as the first rating indicator may be considered as erroneous if the comparison output reveals substantial difference between the historical profile component of the rating entity and an average rating profile determined based on the historical rating profiles of the plurality of other rating entities.

A few embodiments are further presented herein as numbered examples.

EXAMPLE 1

The embodiments herein disclose system for publishing an aggregate rating indicator based on a plurality of discrete rating indicators associated with a rated entity. The system may include a search engine for searching a plurality of repositories containing the plurality of discrete rating indicators associated with the entity. Each of the plurality of rating indicators may include a numerical score component and a sentiment score component. The system may further include a special purpose processor for retrieving a first rating indicator published on a repository. The first rating indicator may include a first numerical score component and a first sentiment score component. The processor may be configured to retrieve a second rating indicator published on a personalized social networking platform section. The second rating indicator may include a second numeric score component and a second sentiment score component. The processor may be configured to retrieve a third rating indicator published with a local storage component associated with the rated entity or a ratting entity. The third rating indicator may include a third numeric score component and a third sentiment score component.

The system may include a memory circuit communicatively and operatively connected with the special purpose processor for storing the first rating indicator, the second rating indicator, and the third rating indicator. The system may include a rating filter or filtering engine communicatively coupled with the special purpose processor and the memory circuit for filtering out a fraudulent rating indicator. The fraudulent rating indicator is determined based on a combination of parameters including such as a geo-location coordinate similarity between a rating entity and the rated entity, gender identification, age specifics, frequency of the rating indicator of the rated entity by the rating entity, sentiment writing style, duration between the rating indicator and a subsequent rating indicator by the same rating entity for the same rated entity, duplicate rating indicators provided by the rating entity for the rated entity, use of multiple rating sources for rating the rated entity by the rating entity, and the like. The system may include a rating aggregator communicatively and operatively connected with the special purpose processor for aggregating the first rating indicator, the second rating indicator, and the third rating indicator after filtering out the fraudulent rating indicator such that the aggregation results in an aggregate rating indicator indicative of an equivalent of the plurality of discrete rating indicators other than the fraudulent rating indicator.

EXAMPLE 2

The system of example 1, wherein the repositories are associated with a rating indicator website, a social networking engine, and a healthcare rating indicator agency information source, and the like.

EXAMPLE 3

The system of example 1 further includes a server component communicatively and operatively coupled with the special purpose processor to access the repositories. The server component is further communicatively coupled with individual local storage components residing on a local computing machine remotely located from the server component and the processor component. The server component may be configured to access the individual local storage components. The server component and the processor component together are configured to search digital information stored on the individual local storage components for a rating indicator provided by an individual to the rated entity. The rating indicator resides in the local storage components and may include sentiments, reviews, comments, and views. The server component and the processor may be configured to index the rating indicator, identified by the sentiments, reviews, comments, and the views, in the memory circuit by the special purpose processor. The special purpose processor is further configured to associate a rating indicator category with the rated entity. The aggregate score may be determined for the plurality of discrete rating indicators such that each of the plurality of discrete rating indicators may be linked to the same category. The special purpose processor may further be configured to determine a trust score, and a reliability index for the first rating indicator, the second rating indicator, and the third rating indicator. The first rating indicator, the second rating indicator, and the third rating indicator may qualify for the aggregation when the trust score and the reliability index exceeds a threshold trust score and a threshold reliability score for a specific rating indicator category identified by a rating indicator category identifier maintained by the memory circuit.

The methods of aggregation of the rating indicators as disclosed herein treat each review and rating as an informative as well as a noisy signal of quality. The methods and systems allow optimization of rating aggregation by processing filtering of the rating indicators based on specific parameters as has been discussed in the document. In order to aggregate the individual rating indicators to get an optimal aggregation rating indicator, the rating indicators are weighted for biases and noise prior to aggregation by the rating aggregator  **108**  and the filtering engine  **306**  (or the filter circuit  **962** ). The embodiments herein allow constructing optimal rating indicators for each entity or for each category such as a healthcare delivery organization (HDO) in an example. The optimal rating indicator processed by the filter circuit  **962**  and aggregated by the aggregation engine  **968**  reduces the biases or variations due to differences in reviewers or due to differences in accuracy levels of different rating indicators and/or reliability levels among different reviewers.

The processes of filtering and aggregation to determine an aggregate rating indicator pose several challenges. Finding an aggregate rating indicator depends on personalization data and each user or rating entity may possess his biases or preferences which may affect the aggregate rating indicator. Moreover, each rating entity may agree or disagree with their recommendations even on the same matter associated with the same rated entity. The embodiments herein allow a more robust and reliable rating indicators aggregation by filtering the rating indicators using a multi-filtering approach including the use of parameters-based filtering using the filtering engine enabled through a set of hardware appliances and API as discussed above in conjunction with various figures. The multi-filtering approach is further enabled through a second filtering layer with the use of human APIs (application programming interfaces)  **1202**  as shown in FIG. 12.

FIG. 12, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 11, illustrates an example of filtering of the rating indicators that are obtained from various types of sources through the use of the multi-layer filtering approach. The human APIs  **1202**  initiates manual intervention at specific times to enhance reliability of the rating indicators before aggregation. The human APIs  **1202**  are added automatically to alert manual intervention once the trust and reliability indices associated with the rating indicators go below a threshold level. The human APIs  **1202**  can therefore initiate triggers such as for example to perform background check and/or perform credentialing. The human APIs  **1202**  may initiate an automated phone call or send an email or perform any other service oriented function. The human APIs  **1202**  may allow background assessment with the use of a background assessment engine  **1204**  and credentialing with the use of a credentialing appliance  **1206**. The multi-tier filtering approach of the rating indicators prevents the biases and personalization preferences from impacting the aggregate rating indicator. The multi-tier filtering can for example determine a person rating another wrong person with a similar name. The human APIs  **1202**  initiate the triggers to review and watch applications and verify by phoning or emailing or double checking through physical means based on the generated triggers through the human APIs  **1202**.

Furthermore, the use of the sentiment score component as well as the numerical score component makes the task of aggregation even more complex. The rating indicators may be different, of different types, heterogeneous, and originating from different sources such as the local storage component  **924** , first web-based repository  **926** , and the second web-based repository  **928**  associated with the social engine  **940**  and the like. The aggregating of such rating indicators from such varied sources poses several technologies challenges such as identification of entities that does the ratings. For example, if John Smith submits a rating on the first web-based repository  **926**  and if John Smith submits another rating on the local storage component  **924** , the identity of two John Smith being the same persons may be required to be determined. The identity of the rating entity may need to be established for a reliable rating aggregation score or indicator. Similarly, the same person may have rated an entity on the local storage component  **924**  as well as through a remote web-based repository such as the first web-based repository  **926**. In such cases, the identity of the rating entity and reliability of the rating needs to be assessed since the two ratings may be duplicates and may require filtration. The filtering engine  **306**  disclosed in the present document may perform filtering using the various appliances and modules as discussed in conjunction with various figures. Further, the rating indicators obtained from several sources may include rating indicators on different scales. The aggregation engine  **968**  or the special purpose processor  **116**  may therefore perform homogenization of the discrete rating indicators prior to aggregation so as to organize the rating indicators in same formats.

Still, the retrieval of different types of rating indicators from different types of repositories accessible through different ways poses even more challenges. For example, a rating indicator may be accessed from a personal social networking platform section. Another rating indicator may be acquired from a personal database which may not be connected to a public network and can be networked privately only after authorization by the rating entity. In such cases, the rating entity may store the recommendations, reviews and ratings reserved with a personal data store. Even further, another rating indicator may be retrieved from a public web-based repository accessible through a public network. The embodiments herein address these challenges by deploying a hardware-based appliance  **1208**  in a secured cloud environment  **1210**  of the filtering engine  **306**. The hardware-based appliance  **1208**  may get data such as the rating indicators from a non-secured environment  **1212**  including the various sources of the rating indicators located behind a firewall and push the data to the filtering engine  **306**  in the secured cloud environment  **1210**. The hardware-based appliance  **1208**  is designed to access an agent appliance  **1214**  dropped in behind the firewall in the non-secured environment  **1212**  that does all local collection of the rating indicators. The rating indicators are then pushed out in a harmonized way to the secured cloud environment  **1210**  by the agent device  **1214**  so that the hardware-based appliance  **1208**  collects the pushed data, transforms it for harmonizing it, and submits it to the filtering engine  **306**  prior to aggregation. In an example, harmonization can be done within the secured cloud environment  **1210**.

The hardware-based appliance  **1208**  may be connected with the filtering engine  **306**  to trigger the human APIs  **1202**  and several custom applications deployed through an application layer  **1216**  with automated applications. The automated applications may be executed through such as the geo-location coordinate analysis engine  **946** , gender mapping engine  **948** , writing style analysis engine  **950** , duplicate ratings analysis engine  **952** , age mapping engine  **954** , rating frequency analysis engine  **956** , rating duration analysis engine  **958** , rating sources analysis engine  **960** , and the like. The geo-location coordinate analysis engine  **946**  may generate a first input component indicative of proximity of the rated entity with the rating entity. The gender mapping engine  **948**  may generate a second input component indicative of a gender specific value signifying validity of the rating indicator based on gender specific comparison obtained by comparing with pre-defined gender specific definitions. The writing style analysis engine  **950**  may generate a third input component indicative of validity of the rating indicator obtained by comparison of the writing style with a pre-stored writing style of the rating entity. The duplicate rating analysis engine  **952**  may generate a fourth input component indicative of validity of the rating indicator based on analysis of duplicate ratings from seemingly same persons or rating entities. The age mapping engine  **954**  may generate a fifth input component indicative of age specific value signifying validity of the rating indicator based on age specific comparison obtained by comparing with pre-defined age specific definitions. The rating frequency analysis engine  **956**  generates a sixth input component indicative of validity of the rating indicator based on comparison of the rating frequency with a pre-stored rating frequency threshold. The rating duration analysis engine  **958**  may generate a seventh input component indicative of validity of the rating indicator based on comparison of the rating duration with a pre-stored rating duration threshold. The rating sources analysis engine  **960**  may generate an eighth input component indicative of validity of the rating indicator based on comparison of the variance in the rating sources such as the first web-based repository  **926** , the second web-based repository  **928** , the local storage component or local storage unit or device  **924**  and the like. In an example, the first input component, the second input component, the third input component, the fourth input component, the fifth input component, the sixth input component, the seventh input component, and the eighth input component may be generated through the application layer  **1216**  deployed within the secured cloud environment  **1210**  and these various input components may be submitted by the hardware-based appliance  **1208**  to the filtering engine  **306**  such that values of the various input components decide initiation and triggering of the human APIs  **1202**  for reliability assurance of the rating indicators during filtering process and prior to the aggregation. The various input components may be computer executable.

In an embodiment, the appliance  **1208**  may be an extensible agent appliance. The appliance  **1208**  may be configured to host a plug and play cloud agent. The plug and play agent may consist of a central host such that various functionalities may be added to it as separate plug-ins. New plug-ins may be automatically added into the plug and play agent. The plug and play agent can be installed by the server  **106**  or the special purpose processor  **116**. The appliance  **1208**  is capable of launching a gateway application configured to pair a connected computing machine hosting a repository such as the local storage component  **924**  or the first web-based repository  **926**  or the second web-based repository  **928**  with the server  **106**  or the agent device  **1214**  to allow access of computer executable rating indicators residing on the repositories by the agent device  **1214**. The gateway application allows and automates transfer of the computer executable rating indicators from the computing machine to the server  **106**  or the appliance through the agent device  **1214**.

Determining geographical location coordinates and comparisons between geo coordinates of the rating entity and the rated entity to determine trustworthiness of a rating indicator may involve complex challenges such as who rated the rating entity and whether the rated entity was in proximity of the rating entity so as to ensure reliability of the rating indicator. The application layer  **1216**  may deploy the geo-location coordinate analysis engine  **946**  to determine proximity of the rated entity with the rating entity and to determine whether the rated entity and the rated entity are in a valid geographical area or boundary by establishing a geographical proximity boundary. And, when the rating is done, the geo-location coordinate analysis engine  **946**  prevents completely or adjusts the rating indicator based on whether the rating entity may be the person wanted to rate for example John Smith in NYC but accidentally rated John Smith in Chicago or whether the rating entity and the rated entity are beyond the valid and established geographical proximity boundary. The geo-location coordinate analysis engine  **946**  may enable IP based geography capabilities, WiFi triangulated or coordinated capabilities with WiFi adaptors, physical GPS to deliver geographical coordinate information, and the like.

In an example, the application layer  **1216**  may deploy an appliance to execute time-based comparisons such as to assess for temporal parameters. For example, an office for which a rating is submitted at a particular time was closed and hence the rating indicator so generated may be erroneous.

The embodiments herein may be embodied as a computer program product configured to include a pre-configured set of instructions, which when performed, can result in actions as stated in conjunction with the methods described above. In an example, the pre-configured set of instructions can be stored on a tangible non-transitory computer readable medium or a program storage device. In an example, the tangible non-transitory computer readable medium can be configured to include the set of instructions, which when performed by a device, can cause the device to perform acts similar to the ones described here. Embodiments herein may also include tangible and/or non-transitory computer-readable storage media for carrying or having computer executable instructions or data structures stored thereon. Such non-transitory computer readable storage media can be any available media that can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer, including the functional design of any special purpose processor as discussed above. By way of example, and not limitation, such non-transitory computer-readable media can include RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to carry or store desired program code means in the form of computer executable instructions, data structures, or processor chip design. When information is transferred or provided over a network or another communications connection (either hardwired, wireless, or combination thereof) to a computer, the computer properly views the connection as a computer-readable medium. Thus, any such connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of the computer-readable media.

Computer-executable instructions include, for example, instructions and data which cause a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or special purpose processing device to perform a certain function or group of functions. Computer-executable instructions also include program modules that are executed by computers in stand-alone or network environments. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, components, data structures, objects, and the functions inherent in the design of special-purpose processors, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Computer executable instructions, associated data structures, and program modules represent examples of the program code means for executing steps of the methods disclosed herein. The particular sequence of such executable instructions or associated data structures represents examples of corresponding acts for implementing the functions described in such steps.

The techniques provided by the embodiments herein may be implemented on an integrated circuit chip (not shown). The chip design is created in a graphical computer programming language, and stored in a computer storage medium (such as a disk, tape, physical hard drive, or virtual hard drive such as in a storage access network). If the designer does not fabricate chips or the photolithographic masks used to fabricate chips, the designer transmits the resulting design by physical means (e.g., by providing a copy of the storage medium storing the design) or electronically (e.g., through the Internet) to such entities, directly or indirectly. The stored design is then converted into the appropriate format (e.g., GDSII) for the fabrication of photolithographic masks, which typically include multiple copies of the chip design in question that are to be formed on a wafer. The photolithographic masks are utilized to define areas of the wafer (and/or the layers thereon) to be etched or otherwise processed.

The resulting integrated circuit chips can be distributed by the fabricator in raw wafer form (that is, as a single wafer that has multiple unpackaged chips), as a bare die, or in a packaged form. In the latter case the chip is mounted in a single chip package (such as a plastic carrier, with leads that are affixed to a motherboard or other higher level carrier) or in a multichip package (such as a ceramic carrier that has either or both surface interconnections or buried interconnections). In any case the chip is then integrated with other chips, discrete circuit elements, and/or other signal processing devices as part of either (a) an intermediate product, such as a motherboard, or (b) an end product. The end product can be any product that includes integrated circuit chips, ranging from toys and other low-end applications to advanced computer products having a display, a keyboard or other input device, and a central processor, and may be configured, for example, as a kiosk.

The embodiments herein can include both hardware and software elements. The embodiments that are implemented in software include but are not limited to, firmware, resident software, microcode, etc. Furthermore, the embodiments herein can take the form of a computer program product accessible from a computer-usable or computer-readable medium providing program code for use by or in connection with a computer or any instruction execution system. For the purposes of this description, a computer-usable or computer readable medium can be any apparatus that can comprise, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.

The medium can be an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system (or apparatus or device) or a propagation medium. Examples of a computer-readable medium include a semiconductor or solid state memory, magnetic tape, a removable computer diskette, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), a rigid magnetic disk and an optical disk. Current examples of optical disks include compact disk-read only memory (CD-ROM), compact disk-read/write (CD-R/W) and DVD.

A data processing system suitable for storing and/or executing program code will include at least one processor coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus. The memory elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code, bulk storage, and cache memories which provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution.

Input/output (I/O) devices (including but not limited to keyboards, displays, pointing devices, etc.) can be coupled to the system either directly or through intervening I/O controllers. Network adapters may also be coupled to the system to enable the data processing system to become coupled to other data processing systems or remote printers or storage devices through intervening private or public networks. Modems, cable modem and Ethernet cards are just a few of the currently available types of network adapters.

A representative hardware environment for practicing the embodiments herein is depicted in FIG. 13, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 12. This schematic drawing illustrates a hardware configuration of an information handling/computer system  **1300**  in accordance with the embodiments herein.
