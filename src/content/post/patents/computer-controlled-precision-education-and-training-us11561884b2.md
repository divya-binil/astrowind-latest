Technical Field

The embodiments herein relate to networked systems and, more particularly to a device and method for optimizing operation of networked and computer-controlled appliances generating certain metrics.

Description of the Related Art

Conventionally, automated devices perform operations based on predefined programmable instructions assigned for them. These instructions allow some tasks to be performed irrespective of whether an outcome achieved is desired or not. The instructions take care of performance metrics but not the desired outcome expected from these devices. In many cases, these devices may have to be operated manually or differently based on real-time situations which may cause actual performance metrics to deviate from predefined metrics defined for them. Accordingly, there is a need of a system that is capable of optimizing performance of devices in a network based on contextual situations in which they have to operate.

Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to FIGS.  **1** - **6**  , there are shown exemplary embodiments.

FIG.  **1**  illustrates a high-level overview of a system  **100** , according to embodiments as disclosed herein. The system  **100**  includes computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N connected to an electronic evaluation device  **104**  using a network  **106**  for facilitating transmission of signals containing at least metrics associated with the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, a validation entity  **108**  to provide feedback to the electronic evaluation device  **104** , and a machine learning system  **110**  to generate and train a machine learning model that learns behavior of the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, fault detection pattern, and suitable computer-executable task lists for each of the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N. The system  **100**  includes a worklist management system  **112**  to monitor performance of the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N and assign a goal-based computer-executable task list also referred to as worklist to one or more of the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N in accordance with a set of predefined computer-executable goals.

Each of the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N includes a memory that stores predefined programmable instructions and one or more processors configured to execute the predefined programmable instructions and record one or more computer-executable metric. The one or more computer-executable metric (referred to herein as computer-executable metric or metric) includes a signal indicative of performance of a computer-controlled metric appliance such as  **102** - **1**  and collected from a set of operations performed by the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**. The metric may be collected from the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  to monitor and evaluate performance measures digitally over the network  **106**.

A computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N—may include, but is not limited to, a cellular phone, a smart phone, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a tablet computer, a laptop computer, an Internet of Things (IoT) device, a virtual reality device, a flexible electronic device, a curved electronic device, and a foldable electronic device. The types of computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N used in a scenario may depend on an application in which the invention is practiced. For example, in a healthcare domain, non-limiting examples of the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N can include blood pressure (BP) monitoring devices, electroencephalography (EEG) devices, glucose monitoring devices, drug delivery devices, atrial fibrillation (AF) devices, and other medical devices. In a networking domain, non-limiting examples of the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N may include routers, switches, beacons, sensors, and wireless computers. In an aerospace domain, non-limiting examples of the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N may include aircraft electrical system, aircraft safety system, electrical engines, battery systems, wireless sensors, ventilation systems, and other aircraft devices.

In an example, the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N may refer to an "instrument" which may include without limitations medical device instruments, survey instruments, standalone wearables, and a variety of other "instruments" that may or may not be computer-controlled.

In an example, the network  **106**  may include, but is not limited to, a wireless network, an Internet of Thing (IoT) network, a wired network, or a trusted network such as a block chain network and a combination thereof.

Each of the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N may record the computer-executable metric and send the computer-executable metric to the electronic evaluation device  **104**  via the network  **106**. In an embodiment, the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N sends the computer-executable metric continuously or on a predefined interval as configured by the electronic evaluation device  **104**.

Non-limiting examples of the electronic evaluation device  **104**  includes but are not limited to a cloud server, a central server, an individual computer, and a central controller in an IoT network. The electronic evaluation device  **104**  may be configured to receive the computer-executable metric recorded by the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N and detect a fault or a gap or an error associated with the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N based on predefined programmable instructions assigned to the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N. The predefined programmable instructions are used to determine whether the computer-executable metric is achieved or not. Upon detection of the fault or the gap, the electronic evaluation device  **104**  elicits a feedback from the validation entity  **108**  to validate the fault. Upon detection that the fault as invalid, the electronic evaluation device  **104**  automatically updates the predefined programmable instructions based on the feedback.

In an example, the term fault may be defined as a gap or a difference or an error in the actual value of metric as compared to a value defined for an appliance to perform based on the predefined programmable instructions.

In an example, the fault may be defined as a possible refinement needed in the metric in view of certain expected outcomes even if there is no error detected. In such a scenario, the electronic evaluation device  **104**  may update the predefined programmable instructions based on a feedback from a human-attestation or in an automated manner by a machine in view of real-world data inputs.

In an embodiment, the refinements may be tied to the expected outcomes as identified by the electronic evaluation device  **104**  using artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms and systems. For example, the AI/ML algorithms may detect new inputs and patterns associated with the tasks executed by the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N which may not necessarily be indicative of the errors but new data that require new rules, decisions, and logics for performance and metrics evaluation. The electronic evaluation device  **104**  may accordingly make the necessary refinements so as to change values of expected metrics for subsequent performance and task execution.

In an example, a computer-implemented method for optimizing an operation of the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N in the network  **106**  may include receiving, by the electronic evaluation device  **104** , a computer-executable metric recorded by a computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, wherein the computer-executable metric is generated based on the predefined programmable instructions for the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N. The method may include detecting, by the electronic evaluation device  **104** , the data inputs and patterns requiring the refinement in the predefined programmable instructions provided to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, wherein the pre-defined programmable instructions are used to determine whether the computer-executable metric is achieved or not based on assigned computer-executable tasks. The method may include automatically updating, by the electronic evaluation device  **104** , the pre-defined programmable instructions provided to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N such that the predefined programmable instructions after updating changes an expected outcome of the computer-executable metric.

The electronic evaluation device  **104**  takes corrective actions (referred as "actionable reactions") based on the feedback received in view of the real-world inputs for possible refinements. In an embodiment, the electronic evaluation device  **104**  implements open policy agency (OPA) and related evaluation for metrics across multiple ecosystems (for example, checking one metric in a human-attestation against a real metric coming out of a hardware device to validate data and using the real-time feedback from the validation entity  **108**  will further improvise the overall evaluation process. The real-time feedback may indicate for corrective actions and refinements to be taken at the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N.

Examples of the validation entity  **108**  include but are not limited to, a user of the electronic evaluation device  **104** , an administrator of a computer-controlled metric appliance such as the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, or any system which is communicatively connected to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N.

The electronic evaluation device  **104**  takes corrective actions (referred to as "actionable reactions") based on the feedback received from the validation entity  **108**. In an embodiment, the electronic evaluation device  **104**  implements open policy agency (OPA) and related evaluation for metrics across multiple technological implementations involving manual or machine-involved verification (for example, checking one metric in a human-attestation against a real metric coming out of a hardware device to validate data and using the real-time feedback from the validation entity  **108**  will further improvise the overall evaluation process). The real-time feedback from the validation entity  **108**  may indicate for corrective actions to be taken at the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N which led the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N to deviate from achieving the metric based on the predefined programmable instructions or which caused an incorrect interpretation for something that is otherwise found correct through human attestation because of exceptional or different scenarios that the metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N might have not been taught to recognize because of lack of machine learning. For example, a patient monitor reports that a patient's blood pressure or body temperature was reported as X but a nurse wrote down Y. The electronic evaluation device  **104**  may be configured to identify this kind of error or discrepancy based on the real-time feedback from the validation entity  **108**.

The worklist management system  **112**  may be configured to use as inputs a plurality of parameters associated with the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N and apply one or more machine learning models on the plurality of parameters in order to determine a goal-based computer-executable task list based on a pre-defined set of computer-executable goals for the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N. The computer-executable task list may be assigned to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N to perform its operation according to the predefined set of computer-executable goals.

In an exemplary scenario, there may be situations or devices who know their tasks but do not know when to perform them (either by schedule, location, etc.). There are a lot of tasks that are supposed to be performed at particular times over a particular period of time at a particular location. The worklist management system  **112**  may allow to establish a goal with a common set of tasks that have to be performed in specific order by specific people or devices in particular location by the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N. The worklist management system  **112**  defines such goal-based task lists for each of the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N based on the various parameters and trained machine learning models.

In an embodiment, the plurality of parameters includes, but are not limited to, a location of the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, a type of the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, a capability of the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, a user associated with the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, and historic values for the computer-executable metrics associated with the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N.

The worklist management system  **112**  may provide these parameters as an input to the machine learning system  **110**  to determine the goal-based computer-executable task list to be assigned to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N to achieve the computer-executable goals.

The machine learning system  **110**  may include a predefined operating rule or artificial intelligence (AI) model that may be provided through training or learning. By applying a learning technique to the computer-executable metrics collected by the worklist management system  **112** , the predefined operating rule or AI model of a desired characteristic may be defined. The learning may be performed in the device itself according to an embodiment, and/or may be implemented through a separate server/system.

The AI model may comprise a plurality of neural network layers. Each layer may include a plurality of weight values and may perform a layer operation through calculation of a previous layer and an operation on a plurality of weights. Examples of neural networks may include, but are not limited to, convolutional neural network (CNN), deep neural network (DNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), deep belief network (DBN), bidirectional recurrent deep neural network (BRDNN), generative adversarial networks (GAN), and deep Q-networks.

The electronic evaluation device  **104**  is further described in conjunction with FIG.  **2**  . The worklist management system  **112**  is further discussed in conjunction with FIG.  **3**  .

FIG.  **2**  , with reference to FIG.  **1**  , illustrates a block diagram of the electronic evaluation device  **104** , according to embodiments as disclosed herein. The electronic evaluation device  **104**  includes a processor  **202** , a memory  **204** , a communication interface  **206** , and a computer-executable metric validation controller  **208**.

The processor  **202**  may include, such as a central processing unit (CPU), an application processor (AP), or the like, a graphics-only processing unit such as a graphics processing unit (GPU), a visual processing unit (VPU) and the like. The processor  **202**  may include multiple cores and is configured to execute instructions stored in the memory  **204**  and to perform various pre-defined tasks as discussed herein. The communication interface  **206**  is configured for establishing communication between internal hardware components and with external devices via the network  **106**. The communication interface  **206**  includes an electronic circuit specific to a standard that enables the evaluation device  **104**  to communicate with the worklist management system  **112**  and/or the machine learning system  **110**.

The memory  **204**  stores the instructions that are executed by the processor  **202**. The memory  **204**  may include non-volatile storage elements. Examples of such non-volatile storage elements may include magnetic hard discs, optical discs, floppy discs, flash memories, or forms of electrically programmable memories (EPROM) or electrically erasable and programmable (EEPROM) memories. The memory  **204** , in some examples, may include a non-transitory storage medium. The term "non-transitory" may indicate that the storage medium is not embodied in a carrier wave or a propagated signal. However, the term "non-transitory" should not be interpreted that the memory  **204**  is non-movable. In certain examples, a non-transitory storage medium may store data that can, over time, change (e.g., in Random-access Memory (RAM) or cache).

The computer-executable metric validation controller  **208**  is implemented by processing circuitry such as logic gates, integrated circuits, microprocessors, microcontrollers, memory circuits, passive electronic components, active electronic components, optical components, hardwired circuits, or the like, and may optionally be driven by firmware and software. The circuits may, for example, be embodied in one or more semiconductor chips, or on substrate supports such as printed circuit boards and the like.

The computer-executable metric validation controller  **208**  may be configured to receive the computer-executable metric recorded by such as the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N from the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N and detect a fault associated with the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N based on the predefined programmable instructions provided to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N and/or a worklist assigned to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N. The pre-defined programmable instructions may be used to determine whether the computer-executable metric is achieved or not by comparing the computer executable metric with an actual result or metric delivered by the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N. In an embodiment, a decision about whether the computer-executable metric is achieved or not may be determined by comparing the computer-executable metric recorded by the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N with the predefined programmable instructions assigned to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N.

If the computer-executable metric recorded by the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N does not match with the predefined programmable instructions provided to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, the computer-executable metric is considered as not achieved. If a match is found by comparing the computer executable metric, then the computer-executable metric is considered to be achieved. Further, when the computer-executable metric is not achieved, the fault or discrepancy associated with performance of the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N may be identified and detected and evaluated through various means including human attestation to determine whether it was a real fault or not and accordingly use machine learning techniques to teach a machine for future cases involving similar scenarios when identifying faults.

For example, the predefined programmable instructions for a device such as an auto drug delivery appliance may be configured to deliver a predefined amount of a specific drug to a patient suffering with pneumonia. An attendant however may reconfigure the predefined programmable instructions or stop execution of the pre-defined programmable instructions for a period of time to not deliver the drug as per the predefined programmable instructions but change it to some other value in view of certain contextual parameters noted by the attendant after a due approval process. The computer-executable metric validation controller  **208**  may obtain the metric recorded by the auto drug delivery appliance and decide that the computer-executable metric is not achieved by the auto drug delivery appliance and declare a fault with the auto drug delivery appliance as the computer-executable metric recorded by the auto drug delivery appliance does not match with the predefined programmable instructions.

The computer-executable metric validation controller  **208**  may also determine if the fault or discrepancy associated with the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N crosses a fault threshold or is within a permissible range. In response to detecting the fault crossing the threshold range or threshold count (such as when the fault repeats multiple times frequently), the validation controller  **208**  may report the fault associated with the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N to the validation entity  **108**  and receive a feedback about the fault in real time from the validation entity  **108**.

For example, when a hospital administrator observes many similar medical device failures, the failure may be reported to an in charge handling the medical device to get a real time feedback related to the failures in order to validate the failures. In another example, when an aviation administrator observes that many failures were occurring in a jet, a message is sent to the technician/flight in charge to get the feedback in order to validate the failures and also determine whether they are real failures or something else. This may require a second layer of attestation such as human attestation or something else without limitations for verification of the faults associated with various collected metrics.

Further, the computer-executable metric validation controller  **208**  may determine whether the fault associated with the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N is valid or invalid based on the feedback received in real time from the validation entity  **108** , and automatically update the predefined programmable instructions based on the feedback in response to determining that the fault is invalid.

Although the FIG.  **2**  shows various hardware components of the electronic evaluation device  **104** , it is to be understood that other embodiments are not limited thereon. Further, labels or names of the components as used herein are only for illustrative purposes and do not limit the scope of the invention. One or more components can be combined together to perform same or substantially similar function.

FIG.  **3**  , with reference to FIGS.  **1**  and  **2**  , illustrates a block diagram of the worklist management system  **112** , according to embodiments as disclosed herein. Examples of the worklist management system  **112**  include, but are not limited to, a cloud server, a central server, an individual computer, and a central controller in an IoT network designed and deployed for special purpose to perform a set of worklist management tasks as discussed elsewhere in the document. The worklist management system  **112**  includes a processor  **302** , a memory  **304** , a communication interface  **306** , and a machine learning based task controller  **308**.

The processor  **302**  may comprise a central processing unit (CPU), an application processor (AP), or the like, a graphics-only processing unit such as a graphics processing unit (GPU), a visual processing unit (VPU) and the like. The processor  **302**  may include multiple cores to execute instructions stored in the memory  **304**. The communication interface  **306**  is configured for communicating internally among internal hardware components and with external devices via the network  **106**.

The communication interface  **306**  may include an electronic circuit specific to a standard that enables the worklist management system  **112**  to communicate with the evaluation device  **104**  and/or machine learning system  **110**.

The memory  **304**  stores task lists for the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N and the instructions to be executed by the processor  **302**  for assigning and executing the tasks lists (also referred to as worklists without limitations interchangeably) to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N as per requirements such as including assigning of the tasks lists in view of the goals as discussed elsewhere in the document without limitations. The memory  **304**  may include non-volatile storage elements. Examples of such non-volatile storage elements may include magnetic hard discs, optical discs, floppy discs, flash memories, or forms of electrically programmable memories (EPROM) or electrically erasable and programmable (EEPROM) memories. The memory  **204**  may, in some examples, include a non-transitory storage medium. The term "non-transitory" may indicate that the storage medium is not embodied in a carrier wave or a propagated signal. However, the term "non-transitory" should not be interpreted that the memory  **304**  is non-movable. In certain examples, a non-transitory storage medium may store data that can, over time, change (e.g., in Random-access Memory (RAM) or cache).

The machine learning based task controller  **308**  is implemented by a processing circuitry including such as logic gates, integrated circuits, microprocessors, microcontrollers, memory circuits, passive electronic components, active electronic components, optical components, hardwired circuits, or the like, and may optionally be driven by firmware and software. The processing circuitry may, for example, be embodied in one or more semiconductor chips, or on substrate supports such as printed circuit boards and the like.

The machine learning based task controller  **308**  may be configured to detect a plurality of parameters associated with the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N and determine the computer-executable goals to be achieved by the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N. The machine learning based task controller  **308**  may be configured to apply a machine learning model on the plurality of parameters and the computer-executable goal to determine a computer-executable task list to be assigned to the candidate computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N in order to achieve the computer-executable goals. The computer-executable task list is assigned to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N to efficiently allocate goal-based tasks to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N and to reduce a probability of failures.

If the machine learning based task controller  **308**  observes medical device failures through collected matrices, the machine learning based task controller  **308**  automatically generates the task list for regulators to review and assign to the medical device in order to reduce or correct the failures. The details associated with training of the machine learning model are described in conjunction with FIG.  **4**  .

The machine learning based task controller  **308**  may help to generate the task list by considering various real-time parameters. For example, when a hospital sees many measures and metrics showing patient safety problems, the machine learning based task controller  **308**  may be used to effectively create a task list and assign the task list to safety staff.

Examples of the parameters include, but is not limited to, a location of the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, a type of the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, a capability of the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, a user associated with the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, and historic actual values of computer-executable metrics associated with the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N. The machine learning based task controller  **308**  may utilize one or more of these parameters to assign one or more of the task lists to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N in view of the goals so that a task list is not just executed as a task but is assigned and executed as a goal-based task-list to achieve certain desired computer-executable goals that may be decided utilizing the one or more parameters. In an example, the task list can be assigned to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N whenever the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N is in a particular location so that the goal is tied to the location. In an example, the task list can be assigned to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N whenever the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N is attached to a particular patient or a particular device. In an example, the task list can be assigned to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N so as to be executed at a particular time. In an example, the task list can be assigned to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N so as the task list to be executed by the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N whenever a particular event occurs. Similarly, there could be many other goals and parameters to control assigning and execution of the task list without limitations.

FIG.  **4**  , with reference to FIGS.  **1**  through  **3**  , illustrates a working operation of the machine learning system  **110** , according to embodiments as disclosed herein. In an embodiment, the machine learning system  **110**  includes hardware components that are implemented through an AI model  **401**  to determine the computer-executable task list (Comp. Exe. Task  **1**  . . . N) to be assigned to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N in order to achieve one or more computer-executable goals. The hardware components includes special circuitry such as Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), logic gates, integrated circuits, microprocessors, microcontrollers, memory circuits, passive electronic components, active electronic components, optical components, hardwired circuits, or the like, and may optionally be driven by firmware and software. The circuitry may, for example, be embodied in one or more semiconductor chips, or on substrate supports such as printed circuit boards and the like.

A function associated with the AI model  **401**  can be performed through a non-volatile memory (not shown), a volatile memory (not shown), and a processor (not shown). The processor may include one or more processing units. The processor may be a general purpose processor, such as a central processing unit (CPU), an application processor (AP), or the like, a graphics-only processing unit such as a graphics processing unit (GPU), a visual processing unit (VPU), and/or an AI-dedicated processor such as a neural processing unit (NPU).

The processor (not shown in FIG.  **4**  ) may control processing of the input data in accordance with a predefined operating rule or the AI model  **401**  stored in the non-volatile memory and the volatile memory. The predefined operating rule or the artificial intelligence model (AI model)  **401**  may be provided through training or learning.

The AI model  **401**  may be trained using various set of parameters, metrics measured by the different types of devices and the one or more goals to be achieved. The various parameters can include, for example, a location of the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, a type of the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, a capability of the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, a user associated with the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, and historic actual values of the computer-executable metrics associated with the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N.

The AI model  **401**  may include neural network layers  **402**  as shown in the FIG.  **4**  . Each layer  **402**  has a plurality of nodes  **403**. A value for each of the nodes  **403**  may be determined based on the parameters, metrics measured by the appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, and the one or more goals. Each layer  **402**  performs a layer operation through calculation of a previous layer and an operation on a plurality of weights of the nodes  **403**.

This learning process may train the AI model  **401**  using a plurality of learning datasets to cause, allow, or control the machine learning system  **110**  to make a determination output or prediction output as a set of tasks to be assigned to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N in order to achieve the one or more computer-executable goals. Examples of such learning techniques include, but are not limited to, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, or reinforcement learning.

For example, if a person is trying to setup a smart club that includes sports, gaming, swimming, and social activities, and cultural activities that requires various kinds of equipment and interaction among different people, then the one or more embodiments discussed herein may be used to automatically create and assign machine learning-based task lists to achieve certain goals. The task lists may be assigned such that respective allocated tasks within the task lists are specific to their respective goals.

The machine learning system  **110**  may be configured to determine whether the computer-executable metric is achieved or not by comparing the computer-executable metric actually recorded by the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N with the predefined programmable instructions provided to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N when the goal-based work-list is created and assigned to the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N.

FIGS.  **5** A- **5** C, with reference to FIGS.  **1**  through  **4**  , illustrates a method  **500**  implemented by the electronic evaluation device  **104**  for optimizing an operation of the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N.

At step  **501** , the method  **500**  includes receiving a computer-executable metric recorded by the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N. Each of the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N records their metrics based on performance delivered by them and send this information to the electronic evaluation device  **104**  to verify if their respective metrics are achieved or not on a regular basis for performance monitoring and fault detection and also to determine through a second level attestation such as a human attestation whether a fault, if any, is really a fault or something else in case a metric is identified as not achieved.

At step  **502** , the method  **500**  includes comparing the computer-executable metric recorded by the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N with the predefined programmable instructions assigned to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N. The predefined programmable instructions are used to determine whether the computer-executable metric is achieved or not. In order to determine whether the computer-executable metric is achieved or not, a comparison is performed between the computer-executable metric recorded by the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N and the predefined programmable instructions assigned to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N.

At step  **503** , the method  **500**  includes determining whether the comparison results in a performance match indicative of the metric as achieved. In response to determining that the computer-executable metric recorded by the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N does not match with the predefined programmable instructions assigned to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, at step  **504** , the method  **500**  may include generating a signal indicating that the computer-executable metric is not achieved. Upon detecting the computer-executable metric as not achieved, at step  **505** , the method  **500**  includes detecting a fault associated with the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N. The computer-executable metric is said to be not achieved and a fault is declared with the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N if the match is not established after the comparison.

With a detection of the fault, at step  **506** , the method  **500**  includes determining whether the fault associated with the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N crosses a fault threshold. In response to determining that the fault associated with the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N crosses the fault threshold, at step  **507** , the method  **500**  includes reporting the fault associated with the computer-controlled metric appliance to the validation entity  **108**. In an embodiment, the reporting of the fault is performed by sending a message to the validation entity  **108**.

At step  **508** , the method  **500**  includes receiving the feedback about the fault in real time from the validation entity  **108**  and at step  **509** , the method  **500**  includes determining whether the fault is valid based on the real time feedback received from the validation entity  **108**  or not.

In response to determining that the fault is valid, at step  **510** , the method  **500**  includes automatically updating the predefined programmable instructions assigned to the candidate computer-controlled metric appliance based on the feedback.

In an example without limitations, at step  **511** , the method  **500**  may include detecting a plurality of parameters associated with the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N. The plurality of parameters may include a location of the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, a type of the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, a capability of the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, a user associated with the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N, and historic actual values of the computer-executable metrics of the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N.

At step  **512** , the method  **500**  may include determining one or more computer-executable goals to be achieved by the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N. At step  **513** , the method  **500**  may include applying one or more machine learning models on the plurality of parameters and the one or more computer-executable goals to determine a set of computer-executable tasks to be assigned to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N in order to achieve the one or more computer-executable goals through the task lists.

At step  **514** , the method  **500**  may include assigning the computer-executable task lists to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N.

At step  **515** , the method  **500**  may include updating the machine learning model in response to detecting that the computer-executable metric is achieved or not. The computer-executable metric is determined to be achieved or not by comparing the computer-executable metric recorded by the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N with the predefined programmable instructions assigned to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N. The computer-executable metric is considered as not achieved in response to determining that the computer-executable metric recorded by the computer-controlled metric appliance does not match with the pre-defined programmable instructions assigned to the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N. The machine learning models may be corrected to optimize assigning and/or prediction of the task lists for the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N.

In an example, the method  **500**  may include generating an output signal by the electronic evaluation device  **104** , wherein the output signal triggers a change in operation of the computer-controlled metric appliance such as the computer-controlled metric appliance  **101** - **1**  if the fault is identified to be valid. In an example, the change in operation of the computer-controlled metric appliance  **101** - **1**  may include executing one or more tasks by the computer-controlled metric appliance  **101** - **1**  in accordance with an updated set of the predefined programmable instructions after the feedback.

The various actions, acts, blocks, steps, or the like in the flowcharts of FIGS.  **5** A- **5** C may be performed in the order presented, in a different order or simultaneously. Further, in some embodiments, some of the actions, acts, blocks, steps, or the like can be omitted, added, modified, skipped, or the like without departing from the scope of the invention.

It will be understood that each acts, blocks, steps, or the like in the flowcharts of FIGS.  **5** A- **5** C can be implemented by computer program instructions using special purpose hardware-based computer systems which perform the specified functions or steps, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions. These computer program instructions may be loaded onto a computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus create means for implementing the functions specified in the block diagram, flowchart or control flow block(s) or step(s). These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable memory that can direct a computer or other programmable apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable memory produce an article of manufacture including instruction means which implement the function specified in the flowchart. The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide steps for implementing the functions specified in the block diagram, flowchart or control flow block(s) or step(s).

In an embodiment, the worklist management system  **112**  may be utilized for evidence-based engineering also referred to as 'evidence engineering' in an exemplary embodiment. The processor  **302**  of the worklist management system  **112**  may be configured to define target outcomes and objectives in a machine-readable format referred to as computer-executable 'evidence targets' for a workflow or a set of task. The processor  **302**  may be configured to define a plurality of 'evidence signals' and associate each of the evidence signals with a respective evidence target. The evidence signals are indicative of defined measurable key results for evaluating performance of the computer-controlled medical appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N in the network  **106**  such that values of the evidence signals may be gathered by collecting metrics in the network  **106**. Each metric collected from a computer-controlled metric appliance such as the metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N for a specific task or a series of tasks as governed through a worklist executed by the worklist management system  **112**  may represent an evidence signal that may be compared with a corresponding measurable key result to identify the extent to which the evidence signal as achieved the evidence target. Any evidence signal irrespective of whether the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N achieves or does not achieve the evidence target is suitable to be considered as an evidence-based input for various tasks performed in the network. Metadata may be associated with each such evidence-based input to recognize and read the impact of the evidence signal for achieving the respective evidence target when a series of specific tasks is performed so that futuristic models may determine optimal and efficient solutions for worklist execution not based on pure assumptions but based on evidences collected from past metrics in the form of evidence signals. Each evidence signal represents an evidence-based input for a user or a machine to evaluate, employ, and make machine-based decisions accordingly for executing various tasks irrespective of whether the evidence-based input delivered weak performance or strong performance in past as long as the evidence-based inputs (evidence signals) are well defined, collected, and stored for decision making.

The worklist management system  **112**  may establish data engineering processes and tools necessary to continuously collect and process data (the process referred to as 'evidentiary data collection') to help understand if the key results are met against the defined evidence targets by measuring the evidence signals. This may be achieved by regularly collecting the metrics associated with the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N in the network  **106**.

An evidence engineering-based worklist execution or operation model referred to as EvidenceOps herein and as executed by the worklist management system  **112**  gathers the data or the metrics or the evidence signals, compares them against evidence targets and then makes decisions about how to autonomously, automatically, or with limited minimal human intervention adjusts behavior of a system or the computer-controlled metric appliance  **102** - **1**  . . .  **102** -N etc. given the evidence recorded within the network  **106**.

Evidence or EvidenceOps is utilized in engineering or modeling process because it gives credibility to the findings, recommendations, and decision making. Machine readable evidence is reliable information that support and justify analytical processes, findings and the recommendations. The system  **100**  disclosed herein may be deployed in command centers, wherein the system  **100**  can take aggregated metrics and data that is coming various devices in an operation environment. The system  **100**  may get metrics from ten different data centers, for example, and be able to use trusted networks. The system  **100**  may utilize automated rules so that operational monitoring can be performed. An alert may be generated in case of errors in operations which may become defined as "an incident" so that instead of just starting and reporting the incident as an event or error, the system can tie that to a predefined incident response such as in the form of a task list or a worklist including one or a series of tasks for executing corrective measures.

The system  **100**  allows aggregation of the metrics from several devices and also matching of a rule. The system  **100**  also ensures that an action or a response is taken to rectify a particular need or meet a goal and those actions are then recorded somewhere in a database. The response is then tied back to the original set of metrics to teach a device whether or not this was the right step of action that should have been performed in the first place. If a response is found to be incorrect, the system  **100**  provides a predefined set of rules along with predefined set of incident responses that trigger the incident response based on the rules that will retreat from the metrics and then let the devices or humans do their work and then roll that back into the system  **100**.

The system  **100**  allows aggregation of the metrics across the network  **106**  and maintain them in the network (such as in a blockchain network or in any other trusted network) and allows some actions that need to be taken as responses in view of certain incidences that may occur in different locations such as data centers and different hospitals or other units.

The collecting of metrics and reporting and alerting is followed by actions or tasks that are to be executed.

The system  **100**  may store in a database commonly considered responses and incidents that can be covered as use-cases and use them as rules for driving the task lists for the devices (or metric appliances).

In an example, for a task list selection for achieving certain goals, the system  **100**  will define them first and then identify the metrics which were aggregated from the devices to match certain rules and provide an action plan from associated one or two or many more worklists that drive actions of the devices.

In an example, the system  **100**  may utilize open policy agency, CUE (scoring DSL), and related evaluation techniques for metrics across multiple ecosystems (for example, checking one metric in a human-attestation against a real metric coming out of a hardware device to validate data).

In an example, the embodiments herein can provide a computer program product configured to include a pre-configured set of instructions, which when performed, can result in actions as stated in conjunction with various figures herein. In an example, the pre-configured set of instructions can be stored on a tangible non-transitory computer readable medium. In an example, the tangible non-transitory computer readable medium can be configured to include the set of instructions, which when performed by a device, can cause the device to perform acts similar to the ones described here.

The embodiments herein may also include tangible and/or non-transitory computer-readable storage media for carrying or having computer-executable instructions or data structures stored thereon. Such non-transitory computer readable storage media can be any available media that can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer, including the functional design of any special purpose processor as discussed above. By way of example, and not limitation, such non-transitory computer-readable media can include RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to carry or store desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions, data structures, or processor chip design. When information is transferred or provided over a network or another communications connection (either hardwired, wireless, or combination thereof) to a computer, the computer properly views the connection as a computer-readable medium. Thus, any such connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of the computer-readable media.

Computer-executable instructions include, for example, instructions and data which cause a special purpose computer or special purpose processing device to perform a certain function or group of functions. Computer-executable instructions also include program modules that are executed by computers in stand-alone or network environments. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, components, data structures, objects, and the functions inherent in the design of special-purpose processors, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Computer-executable instructions, associated data structures, and program modules represent examples of the program code means for executing steps of the methods disclosed herein. The particular sequence of such executable instructions or associated data structures represents examples of corresponding acts for implementing the functions described in such steps.

The techniques provided by the embodiments herein may be implemented on an integrated circuit chip (not shown). The chip design is created in a graphical computer programming language, and stored in a computer storage medium (such as a disk, tape, physical hard drive, or virtual hard drive such as in a storage access network. If the designer does not fabricate chips or the photolithographic masks used to fabricate chips, the designer transmits the resulting design by physical means (e.g., by providing a copy of the storage medium storing the design) or electronically (e.g., through the Internet) to such entities, directly or indirectly. The stored design is then converted into the appropriate format (e.g., GDSII) for the fabrication of photolithographic masks, which typically include multiple copies of the chip design in question that are to be formed on a wafer. The photolithographic masks are utilized to define areas of the wafer (and/or the layers thereon) to be etched or otherwise processed.

The resulting integrated circuit chips can be distributed by the fabricator in raw wafer form (that is, as a single wafer that has multiple unpackaged chips), as a bare die, or in a packaged form. In the latter case the chip is mounted in a single chip package (such as a plastic carrier, with leads that are affixed to a motherboard or other higher level carrier) or in a multichip package (such as a ceramic carrier that has either or both surface interconnections or buried interconnections). In any case the chip is then integrated with other chips, discrete circuit elements, and/or other signal processing devices as part of either (a) an intermediate product, such as a motherboard, or (b) an end product. The end product can be any product that includes integrated circuit chips, ranging from toys and other low-end applications to advanced computer products having a display, a keyboard or other input device, and a central processor.

Furthermore, the embodiments herein can take the form of a computer program product accessible from a computer-usable or computer-readable medium providing program code for use by or in connection with a computer or any instruction execution system. For the purposes of this description, a computer-usable or computer readable medium can be any apparatus that can comprise, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.

The medium can be an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system (or apparatus or device) or a propagation medium. Examples of a computer-readable medium include a semiconductor or solid-state memory, magnetic tape, a removable computer diskette, a random-access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), a rigid magnetic disk and an optical disk. Current examples of optical disks include compact disk-read only memory (CD-ROM), compact disk-read/write (CD-R/W) and DVD.

A data processing system suitable for storing and/or executing program code will include at least one processor coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus. The memory elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code, bulk storage, and cache memories which provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution.

Input/output (I/O) devices (including but not limited to keyboards, displays, pointing devices, etc.) can be coupled to the system either directly or through intervening I/O controllers. Network adapters may also be coupled to the system to enable the data processing system to become coupled to other data processing systems or remote printers or storage devices through intervening private or public networks. Modems, cable modem and Ethernet cards are just a few of the currently available types of network adapters.

The invention described herein improvises overall hardware performance of the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102**  as the predefined programmable instructions defined for the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102**  are automatically updated as needed to change an expected outcome of the computer-executable metric based on actual requirements instead of delivering faulty or inaccurate performance by the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102**.

The computer-controlled metric appliances  **102**  hence will better be able to operate to achieve the metric based on updated predefined programmable instructions after the evaluation. This enables efficient use of the computer-controlled metric appliances  **102**. With the updated predefined programmable instructions, the operation of the computer-controlled metric appliance will automatically change so as to deliver the expected performance which results in optimization.

This schematic drawing illustrates a hardware configuration of an information handling/computer system  **600**  in accordance with the embodiments herein. The system  **600**  comprises at least one processor or central processing unit (CPU)  **10**. The CPUs  **10**  are interconnected via system bus  **12**  to various devices such as a random-access memory (RAM)  **14** , read-only memory (ROM)  **16** , and an input/output (I/O) adapter  **18**. The I/O adapter  **18**  can connect to peripheral devices, such as disk units  **11**  and tape drives  **13** , or other program storage devices that are readable by the system  **600**. The system  **600**  can read the inventive instructions on the program storage devices and follow these instructions to execute the methodology of the embodiments herein. The system  **600**  further includes a user interface adapter  **19**  that connects a keyboard  **15** , mouse  **17** , speaker  **24** , microphone  **22** , and/or other user interface devices such as a touch screen device (not shown) to the bus  **12**  to gather user input. Additionally, a communication adapter  **20**  connects the bus  **12**  to a data processing network, and a display adapter  **21**  connects the bus  **12**  to a display device  **23**  which may be embodied as an output device such as a monitor, printer, or transmitter, for example.
