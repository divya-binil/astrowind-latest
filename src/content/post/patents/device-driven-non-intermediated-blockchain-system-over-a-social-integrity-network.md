The data object files are created by compilers and assemblers and contain generated binary code and data for a source file. The database components can include any of tables, indexes, views, stored procedures, and triggers.

The embodiments herein provide a method and system for creating, controlling and managing portions of health care records more specifically electronic health care records via a multi-faceted social health care component to enable social interaction among one or more entities (hereafter entities). The multi-faceted social health care component is configured to allow collaboration and interaction among the entities through a Social Health Record Data Bank (SHRDB). The SHRDB can be configured to provide a repository for the storage of a plurality of such as electronic healthcare records generated by the entities. The various portions of the multi-faceted social health care component can be accessed by the entities based on entity specific preferences and roles. In accordance with some embodiments, the entities may be communicatively connected among themselves. For example, the entities can interact through emailing, Instant Messaging, or various other modes. In some embodiments, the entities can connect or interact among themselves even without going through the SHRDB (thus bypassing the SHRDB).

In an embodiment, the medical records or health records can be social health records or social records simply. The social health records referred herein can be understood as medical records stored in a central or distributed storage database such as the SHRDB and associated proxy locations. In an embodiment, the social health records referred herein can be understood as medical records collected from several distinct locations such as several social aware networks or applications or devices or sensors or other information sources (also referred to as data sources interchangeably without limitations) and brought at a single location such as the SHRDB or ad distributed setup such as the SHRDB and associated proxy locations such as a social federation proxy. The social records thus collected and integrated at these locations can further be distributed socially among several entities such as users individually or through social networks or applications. Therefore, the present system and method provides a mechanism for two-way communication between several entities and/or devices and the social aware networks wherein the records can be collected from the social aware networks or applications or devices or input by the entities as well as distributed toward the social aware networks or applications or devices or to the entities. In such embodiments, the social records can be considered as the medical records floated over a network for allowance toward such a two-way communication.

In various embodiments discussed below, the terms 'medical records', 'health records', 'social records', 'electronic records', 'medical health records', 'social health records' are interchangeably used without limitations. The terms entities and users are used interchangeably without limitations. The terms social aware network, and social network are used interchangeably without limitations. The terms 'data' and 'record' are used interchangeably without limitations.

In some embodiments, the multi-faceted social health care component can be a blockchain configured multi-faceted social health care component, the SHRDB can be a blockchain configured SHRDB, the social federation proxy and/or other proxy locations can be blockchain configured social federation proxy locations, and entire system can be completely or partially blockchain configured distributed over a social integrity network as discussed later at least in conjunction with some embodiments.

The blockchain configured digital ecosystem and associated components provided by the embodiments herein, also referred to as a "smart contract based distributed integrity network" does not require a centralized health information exchange (HIE) operator because all participants may have access to distributed ledgers to maintain a secure exchange without broken trusts. This allows disintermediation by removing human participants from a chain of the participants such as entities. Additionally, the health data records are distributed across a plurality of storage locations in the blockchain accessible by the participants simultaneously and allowing the ability to make updates almost in real time. The blockchain configured digital ecosystem provides a secured, disintermediated and distributed framework to amplify and support integration of healthcare information across a range of uses and stakeholders defined by the entities. The blockchain configured digital ecosystem facilitates a secured and distributed framework for patient digital identities to allow access to body worn personally connected health devices, connected health devices at home and other facilities, storage devices and servers hosting the medical records and the like, with the use of private and public encryption/authentication/validation keys secured through cryptography and thus protecting patient identity by allowing a restricted access to a particular entity in accordance with dynamic rules and policies along with strong identity validation mechanisms using blockchain configured validation devices across the integrity network. The distributed nature of the blockchain configured digital ecosystem enables shared data which provides near real-time updates across a network accessible to all authorized entities without the need for a centralized authority or exchange.

The data corresponding to an individual entity may or may not have been derived from medical testing or treatment (e.g., the data may have been derived from a research organization trial in which the individual voluntarily participated or data may have been derived from insurance services or any other source). More generally, "electronic health care records" may include data related to doctor's visits, lab tests, hospital stays, clinical trials, patient problems, patients health information, patient habits, patient medical history, patient appointments, patient medical insurance, patient medical bills status, or any other information.

The entities  **102**  may subscribe or register with the SHRDB  **106**  to create, view, edit, manage, and control the plurality of health care records via the multi-faceted social health care component  **104**. The SHRDB  **120**  stores the information about the entities  **102**  in a policy controller  **114**. The information described herein can be related to the role of the entities  **102** , preferences of the entities  **102**  or any other information. The policy controller  **114**  includes one or more rules to control an access to the multi-faceted social health care component  **104**  based on the roles and preferences of the entities  **102**. The policy controller  **114**  interacts with the processing component  **112**  to control access of the entities  **102**  to the electronic health care records. In an embodiment, the policy controller  **114**  is configured to generate an output based on the rules defined, and roles and preferences of the plurality of entities  **102** , upon receipt of a request from an entity such as  **102**  1 for accessing the SHRDB  **106**. The output is a function dependent on such as the rules, roles and the preferences. In an embodiment, the processing component  **112**  can evaluate the value of the output. In an embodiment, the function can be subjectively defined. In another embodiment, the function can be mathematically and analytically defined such that upon receipt of values of the concerned rules, roles and the preferences corresponding to a particular entity  **102**  1, the value of the function that is indicative of the output may be evaluated by the processing component  **112**. In such embodiments, the rules, and roles and the preferences may also be defined through a mathematical function such as based on statistical tools, scaling or rating techniques, or in the form of any other mathematical expression. The output generated either through a subjective approach or an objective or a mathematical approach may be used by the multi-faceted social health care component  **104**  to authorize and control access of the plurality of entities  **102**. In an embodiment, the multi-faceted social health care component  **104**  is communicatively coupled to the SHRDB  **106**  and adapted to be accessible by each of the plurality of entities  **102**  such that the multi-faceted social health care component  **104**  enables social interaction among the entities  **102**  and the SHRDB  **106**  over the communications network  **108**  for medical records transfer or sharing. The multi-faceted social health care component  **104**  behaves as a centralized or a distributed application and is adapted to automatically control display of the medical data or records based on the rules and the preferences.

The SHRDB  **106**  can be coupled to a report generator  **116**  that may generate health care reports and share them with the entities  **102**  periodically. In an embodiment, the reports can further be approved by the policy controller  **114**  before sharing with the plurality of entities  **102**.

The multi-faceted social health care component  **104**  may be a web-based interface displaying customized graphical interface enabling social interaction among the entities  **102**  over the communication network  **108**. The communications network  **108**  described herein may be the Internet. The multi-faceted social health care component  **104**  can be a centralized application or component or a distributed component that automatically controls display of the electronic health records based on the rules defined in the policy controller  **116**  of the SHRDB  **106**.

As described above also, in accordance with some embodiments, the entities  **102**  may be communicatively connected among themselves. For example, the entities  **102**  can interact through emailing, instant messaging, or various other modes. In some embodiments, the entities  **102**  can connect or interact among themselves even without going through the SHRDB  **106**  (thus bypassing the SHRDB  **106** ). In some embodiments, identifiers may be used during communication among the entities  **102**  to enable a secured communication.

In accordance with some embodiments, the interaction of the entities  **102**  with the SHRDB  **106**  can be intermediated such that an external entity such as a different hospital, health care provider (who may be one of the entities  **102**  as illustrated in various figures) can operate as an intermediary among the entities  **102**  and the SHRDB  **106**. In such cases, a request such as to access the SHRDB  **106**  or for any other purpose may be routed via the external entity. For this, the external entity can be paid for the respective services delivered by the external entity. It must be understood that the term "external" as used herein in conjunction with defining the "external entity" is merely exemplary. However, the "external entity" can be a part of the entities  **102**  or may be an entity external from the group of entities  **102**  as illustrated in various figures.

In accordance with some embodiments, the interaction of the entities  **102**  with the SHRDB  **106**  can be non-intermediated such that no external entity such as a different hospital, health care provider, and the like operates as an intermediary between the entities  **102**  and the SHRDB  **106**. In such cases, the entities  **102**  can directly communicate with the SHRDB  **106**.

In accordance with some embodiments, the mode of interaction of the entities  **102**  with the SHRDB  **106**  can be of the type of "directed" in which an external entity similar to the external entity described above may provide a directed care to the entities. In such cases, the external entity can be paid for the directed care that it provides to the entities  **102**. In case of a directed type of interaction, the external entity may provide directed care, or may provide instructions to the entities  **102** , or monitor instructions being followed by the entities  **102** , or generate reports and share them with the entities  **102** , and the like.

In some embodiments, the interaction of the entities  **102**  with the SHRDB  **106**  can be of the type of "undirected" in which no external entity similar to the external entity described above is involved to provide a directed care.

In some embodiments, the mode of operation and interaction can be purely intermediated, purely non-intermediated (also referred to as disintermediated interchangeably), purely directed, purely undirected, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the mode of interaction may be customized for each of the entities  **102**. For example, an entity such as entity  **102**  1 may receive an intermediated care while entity  **102**  2 may receive a non-intermediated care.

In an embodiment, the plurality of entities  **102**  may include a first entity  **102**  1, a second entity  **102**  2, a third entity  **102**  3, a fourth entity  **102**  4, and a fifth entity  **102**  5. In an aspect, the first entity  **102**  1 receives a purely intermediated care from the SHRDB  **106**  or in combination with a third party. The second entity  **102**  2 receives a purely non-intermediated care from the SHRDB  **106**  or in combination with the third party. The third entity  **102**  3 receives a purely directed care from the SHRDB  **106**  or in combination with the third party. The fourth entity  **102**  4 receives a purely undirected care from the SHRDB  **106**  or in combination with the third party. The fifth entity  **102**  5 receives a customized service with a combination of two or more of the intermediated, non-intermediated, directed, and undirected care from the SHRDB  **106**  or in combination with the third party.

In an embodiment, the multi-faceted social health care component  **104**  is adapted to interact with the first entity  **102**  1 of the plurality of entities  **102**  such that the first entity  **102**  1 receives a purely intermediated care from the SHRDB  **106**  or in combination with a third party, the second entity  **102**  2 of the plurality of entities  **102**  such that the second entity  **102**  2 receives a purely non-intermediated care from the SHRDB or in combination with a third party, the third entity  **102**  3 of the plurality of entities  **102**  such that the third entity  **102**  3 receives a purely directed care from the SHRDB  **106**  or in combination with a third party, a fourth entity  **102**  4 of the plurality of entities  **102**  such that the fourth entity  **102**  4 receives a purely undirected care from the SHRDB  **106**  or in combination with a third party, the fifth entity  **102**  5 of the plurality of entities  **102**  such that the fifth entity  **102**  5 receives a combination of two or more of the intermediated, non-intermediated, directed, and undirected care from the SHRDB  **106**  or in combination with a third party.

In an embodiment, the multi-faceted social health care component  **104**  is configured to identify at least one source location and a target location upon receipt of a request from an entity such as  **102**  1. The source location is defined as at least a portion of the medical records that is requested by an entity  **102**  1 that sends a request to the SHRDB  **106**  to such as view or receive at least a portion of the medical records or allow another entity such as  **102**  2 or any other entity to view or receive the at least a portion of the medical records. In other words, the source location specifies at least a portion of the medical records. The target location or the target location entity is defined as an entity that is authorized by the request sending entity through the request to view or receive at least the portion of the medical records (that is the source location). The target location entity such as  **102**  2 thus serves as a recipient entity of the at least a portion of the medical records or the source location. The target location  **102**  2 may be identified by such as one or more of (a) an explicit or implicit permission from an owner of the source location such as an owner of the at least a portion of the medical records such as  **102**  1, (b) an indication of the extent of sharing that is the extent and nature of the medical records or the source location, (c) a nature and characteristic of the target location  **102**  2, (d) a purpose of the sharing of the medical records to the target location  **102**  2, and (e) a timeframe for allowance of sharing of the at least a portion of the medical records. In an aspect, for example, the request sending entity  **102**  1 may define a specific name and identifier of the target location entity  **102**  2 in the request such as through an implicit or explicit permission from the owner  **102**  1 of the source location such as the owner  **102**  1 of the at least a portion of the medical records and thus the target location  **102**  2 can be identified and defined from the request. In an aspect, the owner entity  **102**  1 may send the request including a rule or may predefine a rule providing details about the entities who can be allowed to access a defined portion of the medical records and to a defined extent. The owner entity  **102**  1 can in such case define such as an indication of the extent of sharing that may vary for different target entities. The target location  **102**  2 can thus be defined or identified by the SHRDB  **106**. In an aspect, the owner entity  **102**  1 may define a rule for sharing of the at least a portion of the medical records such as based on the nature and characteristics of the target location  **102**  2. For example, a particular owner  **102**  1 of the at least a portion of the medical records may define a rule such that only hospitals can access a defined portion of the medical records, while any research institute may no access, and the like. In another aspect, the purpose of the sharing may also govern the identification of the target location  **102**  2 for example an owner entity such as  **102**  1 may define that a particular portion of the medical records may be accessed only for the purpose of nursing and surgical care, and not for research purposes, and the like. In another aspect, the target location  **102**  2 may be defined based on a timeframe for allowance of sharing of the medical records. For example, an owner entity  **102**  1 may allow a particular target location  **102**  2, through such as the request or by predefining, to access the at least a portion of the medical records for a predefined period of time only. In some embodiments, only one of the (a) to (e) may govern identification of the target location  **102**  2. In an embodiment, more than one of the (a) to (e) may govern selection or identification of the target location  **102**  2. In an embodiment, the parameters (a) to (e) may be defined mathematically through a mathematical function and statistical tools such that that any target location such as  **102**  2 may be evaluated for various variables based on the parameters (a) to (e) to determine a cumulative effect numerical value for assessing the level of sharing of the medical records, if any. The function considering the impact of the (a) to (e) may be evaluated by such as the processing component  **112**. In an embodiment, the target location  **102**  2 is automatically determined based on one or more of (a) to (e) upon receipt of the request from the owner entity  **102**  1 or is predefined within the SHRDB  **106**  by the owner entity  **102**  1.

In an embodiment, in addition to or alternatively, the source location may also be defined based on and may be dependent on such as the parameters (a) to (e) or any other parameter.

In an embodiment, the sharing of the at least a portion of the medical records with the target location  **102**  2 may include providing viewing rights to the target location  **102**  2. In this embodiment, the SHRDB  **106**  may be configured to allow partial viewing of the medical records corresponding to the owner entity  **102**  1 by the target location  **102**  2 based on the one or more of (a) to (e), and based on the request from the owner entity  **102**  1 or based on predefined rules by the owner entity  **102**  1. In an embodiment, the SHRDB  **106**  may be configured to stop any viewing or select which parts to be viewed by the target location  **102**  2 based on the one or more of (a) to (e) and based on the request from the owner entity  **102**  1 or based on predefined rules by the owner entity  **102**  1. In an embodiment, the SHRDB  **106**  may be configured to determine or facilitate the owner entity  **102**  1 of the medical records to determine who has viewed the medical records. Based on knowing who has viewed the medical records, the owner entity  **102**  1 may redefine or may be facilitated by the SHRDB  **106**  to accordingly redefine the one or more of the (a) to (e). The owner entity  **102**  1 may also accordingly make a decision or may be facilitated by the SHRDB  **106**  to make a decision about the partial viewing of the medical records (that is the source location) corresponding to the owner entity  **102**  1 by the target location  **102**  2 based on the redefined one or more of (a) to (e). In an embodiment, the owner entity  **102**  1 may also accordingly make a decision or may be facilitated by the SHRDB  **106**  to make a decision about the stopping of any viewing or selecting which parts to be viewed of the medical records (that is the source location) corresponding to the owner entity  **102**  1 by the target location  **102**  2 based on the redefined one or more of (a) to (e).

In an embodiment, the social health care component  **104**  of the SHRDB  **106**  is configured to identify who has viewed the medical records in real time and share information about who has viewed the medical records with the owner  **102**  1 in real time, such that the owner  **102**  1 allows fully or partially or stops viewing of the medical records by the target location  **102**  2 in real time. In an embodiment, the allowance or denial by the owner  **102**  1 can be performed manually such as without predefining rules and guidelines for allowance and denial. In accordance with such embodiments, the owner entity  **102**  1 can be facilitated to control viewing rights of the at least a portion of the medical records on it owns without predefining any rules. For example, the owner  **102**  1 may initially allow access to any of the plurality of entities  **102**  and then receive information from the SHRDB  **106**  about who has viewed the medical records. Based on who has viewed the medical records and further information about who has viewed the medical records and also the purpose of viewing of the medical records, the owner entity  **102**  1 may decide as to whether the owner entity  **102**  1 should allow at least partial viewing of the at least a portion of the medical records by other entities such as  **102**  2 or stop viewing. This may be decided in association with such as the parameters (a) to (e).

In an embodiment, during the time of initial accessing of the at least a portion of the medical records and the time the owner entity  **102**  1 decides whether to allow viewing or stop viewing the medical records by the entities, the owner entity  **102**  1 may be facilitated by the SHRDB  **106**  to allow other entities to view a portion of the at least a portion of the medical records as defined by the owner entity  **102**  1 referred to as 'no objection segment' of the at least a portion of the medical records. The 'no-objection' segment for example may refer to some non-confidential or superficial details of the medical records, in an embodiment, and not any detailed or confidential data. In an embodiment, the 'no-objection' segment of the medical records can be allowed to be viewed by the entities such as  **102**  2 for a defined period of time after initiation of viewing by the entities. In an aspect, if the owner entity  **102**  1 decides about allowance or denial of further viewing of the medical records in addition to the 'no-objection' segment in a time that is less than the defined time for the 'no-objection' segment viewing, then the decision of allowance or denial can be implemented to either allow further viewing by the entities beyond the 'no-objection' segment in case of allowance, or stop further viewing in case of denial, or allow to view only the 'no-objection' segment. In such embodiments where the time to allow or deny the viewing beyond the 'no-objection segment' is less than the defined time, then the 'no-objection' segment viewing may be converted to viewing as decided or authorized by the owner  **102**  1. If the time to allow or deny the viewing beyond 'no-objection' segment is more than the defined time then the 'no-objection' segment viewing time may be extended by the owner  **102**  1 by allowing more of medical records under 'no objection' to be viewed or repeating a previously viewed 'no-objection' segment of the medical records. The defined time associated with the 'no-objection' viewing and the portion of the medical records corresponding to the 'no objection' viewing may be further defined by the owner entity  **102**  1 automatically or manually based on one or more of the parameters (a) to (e) or any other parameter.

The connections connecting the various entities  **102**  as shown in FIG. 1 are merely to illustrate the possibility of the entities  **102**  to interact among themselves. This should not be considered to limit the entities  **102**  to be located at a single place or directly connected. A direct connection or singly located may not necessarily be true, however possible. The entities  **102**  may still be located remotely and communicate through wired mode or wireless mode.

In some embodiments, the multi-faceted social health care component  **104**  may also be referred to as a multi-faceted electronic health care component. Similarly, the SHRDB  **106**  may also be referred to as EHRDB (Electronic Health Record Databank).

The SHRDB  **106**  can allow entity  **102**  1 and entity  **102**  2 to view the information of each other and interact with each other via the multi-faceted social health care component  **104** , which may result in forming the social cloud among the entities  **102**  1 and  **102**  2. The above description is provided with an example with respect to entity  **102**  1 and entity  **102**  2. Similarly, various other entities  **102**  may also interact among themselves.

FIG. 4, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 3B, illustrates generally, but not by the way of limitation, among other things, a schematic diagram depicting a communication environment  **400** , in which at least some embodiments herein may operate. The environment  **400**  provides a high-level view of the one or more entities  **102**  communicating with the multi-faceted electronic health care component  **104**  provided by the Social Health Record Data Bank (SHRDB)  **106**  over the communications network  **108**  in an embodiment. In accordance with the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 4, a social federation proxy  **402**  is coupled to the SHRDB  **106**  or a server hosting the SHRDB  **106**. The social federation proxy  **402**  is configured to retrieve relevant portions of the medical records or social records from the SHRDB  **106**  associated with an entity such as entity  **102**  1 upon a request from entity  **102**  1. While the SHRDB  **106**  is configured to store and manage the social records corresponding to the plurality of entities  **102** , the social federation proxy  **402**  may or may not store the social records. In an embodiment, the social federation proxy  **402**  may provide a virtual view of the storage to the entities  **102**. In an embodiment, the social federation proxy  **402** , upon retrieval of the social records from the SHRDB  **106** , can display or present them to the entities  **102**  upon request from the entities  **102**  such that the viewers get a feel as if they are viewing or accessing the SHRDB  **106**  directly. With this implementation, the social federation proxy  **402**  may not behave as a storage facility, instead, provides a virtual platform for the entities  **102**  to such as view the displayed or presented social records as requested by them through such as displays, presentations, visuals, graphics, and the like and also edit or manage the records. In an embodiment, however, the social federation proxy  **402**  may store the records actually so that multiple copies of the records can be located at different locations. The social federation proxy  **402**  may pull the social records from the SHRDB  **106**  for presentation, display, and the like either permanently or only when accessed instead of permanent storage. In case the records are not stored at the social federation proxy  **402** , it can maintain references to the records stored in the SHRDB  **106**  so that upon access by the entities  **102** , the records can be fetched from the SHRDB  **106**.

In an embodiment, the social federation proxy  **402**  allows the two-way communication between the entities  **102**  and the SHRDB  **106**. For example, the SHRDB  **106**  can collect the social records from several social aware networks or applications  **118**  such as through the entities  **102**  that are associated with the several social aware networks or the applications  **118**. The social records can be obtained from other sources such as various devices and sensors as discussed above and further elaborated in conjunction with subsequent figures. The collected social records can be stored in a physical storage of the SHRDB  **106**. The social records thus stored in the SHRDB  **106**  can further be retrieved by the entities  **102**  and thus distributed across the various social aware networks or the applications  **118**  through the social federation proxy  **402**. The entities  **102**  can enjoy the facility of integration, distribution and retrieval of the social records all at the same time without even knowing that the access is or the social records are routed through two different levels—social federation proxy  **402**  and the SHRDB  **106**. In some embodiments, a virtualization layer may be provided to create a virtual environment that is capable of allowing the entities  **102**  to share their social records from the social aware networks or the applications  **118**  and also view or retrieve the social records from the social federation proxy  **402**  hiding the difference between the social federation proxy  **402**  and the SHRDB  **106**  from the entities  **102**. FIG. 4 illustrates only one social federation proxy  **402** ; however, multiple such social federation proxies may be employed to provide a distributed architecture.

In an embodiment, a service facility  **404**  may be provided with the SHRDB  **106**. The service facility  **404**  may be configured to provide various services such as intermediated care, non-intermediated care, directed care, undirected care, and custom care to the entities  **102**. The services can be provided by the SHRDB  **106**  directly. In another embodiment, the SHRDB  **106**  can be connected to a third party  **406**  such as to provide the various services either through or in combination with the third party  **406**.

FIG. 5, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 4, illustrates a method flowchart for accessing the SHRDB  **106**  by an entity such as entity  **102**  1. At step  **510** , the SHRDB  **106**  receives a request from entity  **102**  1 for accessing the multi-faceted SHRDB  **106**. At step  **520** , the SHRDB  **106**  or the processing component  **112**  may authenticate entity  **102**  1. Once authenticated, the SHRDB  **106**  determines access right of entity  **102**  1 based on defined policies, rules and preferences such as those identified by the SHRDB  **106**  or pre-stored in the policy controller  **114** , at step  **530**. In some embodiments, the SHRDB  **106**  may retrieve the medical records from the repository as requested in the request of entity  **102**  1, at step  **540**. The step of retrieving of the medical records may include at least one of sharing of the medical records either partially or fully to entity  **102**  1 or to any other entity  **102**  2 of the plurality of entities  **102**  as suggested or authorized by the owner entity  **102**  1 and allowing viewing of the medical records at least partially by entity  **102**  1 or  **102**  2.

In an embodiment, the method may include retrieving the social records, collected by the SHRDB  **106**  from several distinct locations such as distinct social aware networks or applications  **118** , by the social federation proxy  **402**  such as for displaying or presenting the social records to the entities  **102**. In an embodiment, the method allows the two-way communication between the entities and the SHRDB  **106**  with the use of the social federation proxy  **402**. For example, the SHRDB can collect the social records from several social aware networks or applications  **118**  such as through the entities  **102**  that are associated with the several social aware networks or the applications  **118**. The collected social records can be stored in a physical storage of the SHRDB  **106**. The social records thus stored in the SHRDB  **106**  can further be retrieved by the entities  **102**  and thus distributed across the various social aware networks or the applications  **118**  through the social federation proxy  **402**.

In some embodiments, the method may also include determining a type of service to be provided to entity  **102**  1 or  **102**  2 such as a service involving pure intermediated care, pure non-intermediated care, directed care, undirected care or a combination thereof as discussed above. Accordingly, the determined type of service may be initiated and provided to entity  **102**  1 by the SHRDB  **106**  or in combination with third parties  **406**.

In an embodiment, the request from entity  **102**  1 may further include an instruction to share at least a portion of the medical records to entity  **102**  1 or the target location entity  **102**  2. In case of sharing with an entity other than the owner entity  **102**  1 such as entity  **102**  2, the method may include sharing the at least a portion of the medical records based on at least one of (a) an explicit or implicit permission from entity  **102**  1, (b) an indication of the extent of sharing, (c) a nature and characteristic of the target location entity  **102**  2, (d) a purpose of the sharing of the medical records to the target location entity  **102**  2, and (e) a timeframe for allowance of sharing of the medical records. In an embodiment, the step of sharing of the medical records with the target location  **102**  2 may include providing viewing rights to the target location  **102**  2 such that the method allows partial viewing of the at least a portion of the medical records by the target location  **102**  2 based on the one or more of (a) to (e) or stop any viewing or select which parts to view based on the one or more of (a) to (e), or determine or facilitate entity  **102**  1 to determine who has viewed the medical records. In an embodiment, the method may include redefining the one or more of the (a) to (e). The method may include making a decision about the partial viewing of the at least a portion of the medical records by the target location entity  **102**  2 Based on the one or more of (a) to (e) and the stopping of any viewing and selecting which parts to view based on the one or more of (a) to (e). Though parameters such as (a) to (e) are defined herein but it must be appreciated that other parameters may also be defined and considered without limitations.

FIG. 6, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 5, illustrates a device-driven non-intermediated blockchain configured digital ecosystem  **600**  in a social integrity network  **602**. As shown, the various entities  **102**  may access a blockchain configured multi-faceted social healthcare component  **604**  to interact with a plurality of blockchain configured social federation proxies  **606**  _a_,  **606**  _b_,  **606**  _c_,  **606**  _d_, and  **606**  _e _(together referred to as  **606** ). The blockchain configured social federation proxies  **606**  may be communicatively linked with a blockchain configured social health record databank  **608**  to provide a distributed access across the entire social integrity network  **602**  for the entities  **102**.

The entities  **102**  can access the blockchain configured multi-faceted social health care component  **602**  to view, control, and manage healthcare records which may be aggregated from a variety of healthcare information sources. The entities  **102**  may represent patients, clinicians, physicians, diagnostic centers, care takers, care providers, financial institutes engaged in health insurance, taxation etc, and the like as discussed earlier in conjunction with various figures without limitations. The entities  **102** , in an embodiment, may represent computing systems associated with patients, clinicians, physicians, diagnostic centers, care takers, care providers, financial institutes engaged in health insurance, taxation etc, and the like.

The blockchain configured multi-faceted social health care component  **602**  is configured to allow collaboration and interaction among the entities  **102**  through the blockchain configured Social Health Record Data Bank (SHRDB)  **708**  and the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**. The blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  can be configured to provide a repository similar to the repository  **110**  for the storage of data such as the healthcare records generated by the entities  **102**. The various portions of the multi-faceted social health care component  **602**  can be accessed by the entities  **102**  based on entity specific preferences and roles as discussed earlier in conjunction with various figures.

In some embodiments, the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608** , described herein, may be distributed in the form of blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  to serve as disintermediated blocks of the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**. The blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  and the social federation proxy  **606**  can store the electronic health records including data or information related to the entities  **102**  and data coming from various information sources associated with the entities  **102**. The data can be organized in a way that facilitates local or remote information retrieval in the social integrity network  **602**  via a processing component similar to the processing component  **112**. The processing component  **112**  has been described in conjunction with FIG. 1 already.

The entities  **102**  may subscribe or register with the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  to create, view, edit, manage, and control the health records via the blockchain configured multi-faceted social health care component  **602**. The blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  stores the information about the entities  **102**  in a policy controller which may be similar to the policy controller  **114**. The information described herein can be related to the role of the entities  **102** , preferences of the entities  **102**  or any other information. The policy controller  **114**  may include one or more rules to control an access to the blockchain configured multi-faceted social health care component  **602**  based on the roles and preferences of the entities  **102**. The policy controller  **114**  interacts with the processing component  **112**  to control access of the entities  **102**  to the health records. In an embodiment, the policy controller  **114**  is configured to generate an output based on the rules defined, and roles and preferences of the plurality of entities  **102** , upon receipt of a request from an entity such as  **102**  1 for accessing the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**. The output is a function dependent on such as the rules, roles and the preferences. In an embodiment, the processing component  **112**  can evaluate the value of the output. In an embodiment, the function can be subjectively defined. In another embodiment, the function can be mathematically and analytically defined such that upon receipt of values of the concerned rules, roles and the preferences corresponding to a particular entity  **102**  1, the value of the function that is indicative of the output may be evaluated by the processing component  **112**. In such embodiments, the rules, and roles and the preferences may also be defined through a mathematical function such as based on statistical tools, scaling or rating techniques, or in the form of any other mathematical expression. The output generated either through a subjective approach or an objective or a mathematical approach may be used by the blockchain configured multi-faceted social health care component  **602**  to authorize and control access of the plurality of entities  **102**. In an embodiment, the multi-faceted social health care component  **602**  is communicatively coupled to the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  and the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  and adapted to be accessible by each of the plurality of entities  **102**  such that the blockchain configured multi-faceted social health care component  **602**  enables social interaction among the entities  **102**  and the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  over the social integrity network  **602**  for medical records transfer or sharing or editing. The blockchain configured multi-faceted social health care component  **602**  behaves as a distributed blockchain dependent application and is adapted to automatically control display of the medical data or records based on the rules and the preferences.

The blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  can be coupled to a report generator similar to the report generator  **116**  that may generate health care reports and share them with the entities  **102**  periodically. In an embodiment, the reports can further be approved by the policy controller before sharing with the plurality of entities  **102**.

The blockchain configured multi-faceted social health care component  **602**  may be a web-based interface displaying customized graphical interface enabling social interaction among the entities  **102**  over the social integrity network  **602**  in a distributed manner. The social integrity network  **602**  described herein may be enabled through the Internet. The blockchain configured multi-faceted social health care component  **604**  can be a distributed blockchain type application or component that automatically controls display of the electronic health records based on the rules defined in the policy controller  **114**  of the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**.

In an embodiment, the blockchain configured multi-faceted social health care component  **604**  may be configured to identify the at least one source location and the target location upon receipt of a request from an entity such as  **102**  1 in a manner as described in conjunction with various figures particular FIG. 1. The source location and the target location also have been defined in conjunction with FIG. 1. The rules and mechanics defining identification and/or access and/or viewing of the source location or medical records by the entities  **102**  or the target location may be same as those described in conjunction with FIG. 1 without limitations. For example, in an embodiment, more than one of the (a) to (e) may govern selection or identification of the target location such as  **102**  2. In an embodiment, the parameters (a) to (e) may be defined mathematically through a mathematical function and statistical tools such that that any target location such as  **102**  2 may be evaluated for various variables based on the parameters (a) to (e) to determine a cumulative effect numerical value for assessing the level of sharing of the medical records, if any. Various other embodiments have already been discussed in conjunction with FIG. 1 and other figures.

In an embodiment, the blockchain configured social health care component  **604**  of the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  is configured to identify who has viewed the medical records in real time and share information about who has viewed the medical records with the owner  **102**  1 in real time, such that the owner  **102**  1 allows fully or partially or stops viewing of the medical records by the target location  **102**  2 in real time. In an embodiment, the allowance or denial by the owner  **102**  1 is performed manually such as without predefining rules and guidelines for allowance and denial. In accordance with such embodiments, the owner entity  **102**  1 can be facilitated to control viewing rights of the at least a portion of the medical records it owns without predefining any rules. For example, the owner  **102**  1 may initially allow access to any of the plurality of entities  **102**  and then receive information from the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  about who has viewed the medical records. Based on who has viewed the medical records and further information about who has viewed the medical records and also the purpose of viewing of the medical records, the owner entity  **102**  1 may decide as to whether the owner entity  **102**  1 should allow at least partial viewing of the at least a portion of the medical records by other entities such as  **102**  2 or stop viewing. This may be decided in association with such as the parameters (a) to (e). This has been discussed further in conjunction with FIG. 1 and other figures and can be integrated with respect to the embodiment discussed herein in conjunction with FIGS. 6-9.

The blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  is configured to retrieve relevant portions of the medical records or social records from the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  in real time. While the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  may be configured to store and manage the social records corresponding to the plurality of entities  **102** , the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  may create a virtual view of the storage to the entities  **102**  through a distributed storage blockchain infrastructure. The blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606** , upon retrieval of the social records from the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608** , can display or present them to the entities  **102**  such that the viewers get a feel as if they are viewing or accessing the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  directly. With this implementation, the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  may provide a virtual platform for the entities  **102**  to such as view, access or edit the displayed or presented social records as requested by them through such as displays, presentations, visuals, graphics, and the like. The blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  may pull the social records from the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  for presentation, display, access, view, editing, uploading, sharing, and the like.

In an embodiment, the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  allows the two-way communication between the entities  **102**  and the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  by distributing storage and access facility over a wide network at several distributed locations. The blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  can collect the health records and healthcare information from several information sources associated with the entities  **102**. The collected records can be stored in a physical storage of the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**. The records stored in the SHRDB  **608**  can further be accessed at the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**. The entities  **102**  can enjoy the facility of integration, ingestion, distribution and retrieval of the records all at the same time through the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  without even knowing that the access is done or the records are routed through two different levels—blockchain configured social federation proxy level and the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**. In some embodiments, a virtualization layer may be provided to create a virtual environment that is capable of allowing the entities  **102**  to share/access/edit or manage records and also view or retrieve the social records from the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  hiding the difference between the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  and the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  from the entities  **102**.

In an embodiment, the policy controller  **114**  can be operatively and/or communicatively connected with a blockchain validation device  **610**. The blockchain validation device  **610**  may use inputs from the policy controller  **114**  to identify access rules and accordingly execute advanced blockchain validation mechanisms to authorize the entities  **102**  to access and/or manage health records accessible from the blockchain configured multi-faceted social health care component  **604**  through the distributed plurality of blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  linked to the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  simultaneously.

The blockchain configured validation device  **610**  may include a non-volatile computer-readable memory and a processor which may be configured to receive a private key from entity  **102**. Entity  **102**  may be authorized to manage the medical records privately using the private key in conjunction with the inputs from and the rules defined by the policy controller  **114**  for accessing and managing the medical records. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize there can be a variety of different proof standards that could be used by the blockchain validation device  **610**. The proof standard may be based on proof of work, such as hash value requirements, proof of stake, such as a key or other indicator of consensus, or any other kind or proof of consensus. The proof standard may be applied as a rule that may require a hash value to be less than the proof standard, more than the proof standard, or have a required bit sequence or a required number of leading or trailing zeroes. Any proof standard may be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. In an embodiment, the policy controller  **114**  may be configured within the blockchain validation device  **610**.

In an embodiment, the medical records or health records or social health records or social records containing contextual health information can be generated from patients, caretakers, care providers, devices, sensors, social networks and the like. The social health records referred herein can be understood as medical records stored in a central storage database such as the SHRDB  **608**  and the plurality of distributed social federation proxy  **606**. In an embodiment, the social health records referred herein can be understood as medical records collected from several distinct locations such as several social aware networks or applications or devices and brought at the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  and the associated distributed social federation proxy  **606**. The social records thus collected and integrated can further be distributed socially among several entities such as users individually or through social networks or applications.

In an embodiment, the blockchain configured SHDRB  **608**  may contain one or more or all of the components of the SHRDB  **106**  shown in FIGS. 1 and 4. In an embodiment, the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  may contain one or more or all of the components of the social federation proxy illustrated in FIG. 4.

The healthcare information sources which generate and/or provide data or social health records or health records to be aggregated and distributed across the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  and the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  may include a social aware network  **118** , an environment sensor and/or any other sensor  **120** , a wearable health monitoring device  **122** , a GPS-based device  **126** , and a scanner  **124**.

In at least some embodiment, the social aware network  **118**  can be similar to as discussed in conjunction with various figures already. In an embodiment, the social aware network  **118**  may be defined as a network with an arbitrary large number of networked computers accessing the social network  **118**  through registered social profiles. The social network  **118**  facilitates posting and sharing online clinical reviews simultaneously viewable by each of the arbitrary large number of computers including such as a clinical provider computer a patient computer, and the like.

In an embodiment, the social network  **118**  can function as a source of social records signifying social determinants of health which may become a part of the social records (or health records used interchangeably). In an example, the social records signifying the social determinants of health may be input from any of the entity and get stored in the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  and the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  which may then be accessed, managed, and edited by any of entity  **102**  as per access policies maintained by the policy controller  **114**  and/or the blockchain configured validation device  **610**. In an embodiment, the social determinants may include details about economic stability such as pertaining to employment, income, expenses, debt, medical bills, and support. In an embodiment, the social determinants may include details about neighborhood and physical environment such as housing, transportation, safety, parks, playgrounds, workability, and the like. In an embodiment, the social determinants may include details about education such as literacy, language, early childhood education, vocational training, higher education, and the like. In an embodiment, the social determinants may include details about food of an entity such as hunger, access to healthy options, and the like. In an embodiment, the social determinants may include details about community and social context such as social integration, support systems, community engagement, discrimination, and the like. In an embodiment, the social determinants may include details about healthcare systems associated with an entity such as health coverage, provider ability, provider linguistic and cultural competency, and quality of care, and the like. In an embodiment, the social determinants may include details about various health outcomes such as mortality, morbidity, life expectancy, healthcare expenditures, health status, functional limitations, and the like.

In various embodiments, various factors may combine together to form the social determinants which may be aggregated from the social networks  **118**  linked to the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  and the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**. These factors may play an important role in determining health of an individual and may need to be reported to a healthcare provider for facilitating an improved care through the blockchain configured digital ecosystem enabled with the use of the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**. Reporting these factors and associated social determinants about an entity such as a patient in the form of social records entering into the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  can allow an enhanced focus on prevention and primary care, support for testing, and spreading of new delivery and payment arrangements, and initiatives to foster sharing among relevant parties based on shared authorized access of the social records at least in part across the blockchain configured distributed digital ecosystem. Social determinants of health may define determinants and conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. They may include factors like socioeconomic status, education, the physical environment, employment, and social support networks, as well as access to health care as discussed above. In an example, by knowing the social determinants about a patient, associated care provider may know in near real time about measures to be taken for ensuring an effective care plan and accordingly can annotate the social records with inputs to be broadcasted by the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  for view and access by the patient in private and the patient can accordingly take an action. For example, children born to parents who have not completed high school are more likely to live in an environment that poses barriers to health. Their neighborhoods are more likely to be unsafe, have exposed garbage or litter, and have poor or dilapidated housing and vandalism which when reported to the healthcare provider through the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  can ensure necessary precautions, advise, and treatment plans be made available. In an embodiment, data about the social determinants may be input by the patient himself. In an embodiment, the data about the social determinants may be extracted from the associated sensors  **120**  and devices such as weather sensor and the like. In an embodiment, the data about the social determinants may be extracted by cross-referencing associated social networks as discussed elsewhere in the document. In an embodiment, the social determinants may be identified by using geospatial approaches that may allow to predefine social determinants in association with geolocations. As soon as the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  receives the social records from a particular location as identified through associated Global Positioning System (GPS)-based device  **126**  and geo-tags, the predefined social determinants may be mapped on to the received GPS information and the geo-tags to generate a set of social determinants that may be applicable for the entity who submits the social records or from whom the social records are extracted and monitored. This may allow an automated geospatical-based mapping for determining the social determinants of the entities  **102**. In an example, the GPS information may be gathered in the form of latitudes and longitudes. In an embodiment, the GPS information may be gathered in the form of ZIP codes of a locality or city or state or district etc. The GPS device and geo-tags are discussed further later in the document in conjunction with certain embodiments.

The health records may be obtained from the environment sensor  **120**  or any other types of sensors. The environment sensor  **120**  may extract contextual environment related information about an entity such as  **102**  1 and input it into the system through the blockchain configured multi-faceted social healthcare component  **604**. In an example, the environment sensor  **120**  may communicatively connect with the multi-faceted social healthcare component  **604**  and/or the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  so as to allow integration of the contextual medical or health records into the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  and the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  automatically. In an embodiment, an entity such as  **102**  1 may first extract the contextual medical records from the environment sensor  **120**  and input them into the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  and/or blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  manually through the blockchain configured multi-faceted social healthcare component  **604**. In an embodiment, the environment sensor  **120**  may generate information indicative of environmental conditions associated with entity  **102**  1 such as a patient. For, example, a patient may be living in a high polluting environment which may require particular attention from concerned healthcare providers. As soon as the patient inputs this information, the healthcare provider may, in near real-time, get an update and access it through the blockchain configured distributed framework and accordingly make necessary changes in health plans, treatment etc. In an embodiment, the environment sensor  **120**  may be of various types such as a pollution sensor, moisture sensor, smoke sensor, nitrogen oxide (NOX) sensor, different types of gas sensors, rain sensor, temperature sensor, humidity sensor, pressure sensor, salinity sensor, pH sensor, oxygen sensor, carbon dioxide sensor, fluorescence sensor, light sensor, heat sensor, turbidity sensor, sedimentation sensor, and the like. In various embodiments, the health records may be aggregated from various other types of sensors without limitations.

Another information source for aggregating the health records may be the wearable health monitoring device  **122**  including such as wearable medical devices, health monitoring devices, internet of things enabled devices (IoT devices) and the like. The wearable health monitoring device  **122**  may extract individual contextual information from an entity such as a patient during monitoring and analyzing processes and automatically report to the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**.

In an embodiment, the blockchain configured multi-faceted social healthcare component  **604**  may be may be operatively and communicatively connected with a scanner  **124**  to allow scanning and ingestion of scanned health records into the system. In particular, off chain medical records that may not be standardized and available in abstract form may require to be scanned by the scanner  **124**  and then added to the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**. For example, a diagnostic center may scan patient diagnosis reports and ingest them for authorized viewing by the patient and healthcare provider through the blockchain configured multi-faceted social healthcare component  **604**. In an embodiment, the scanner  **124**  may be capable of reading barcode information so that the read information may be input into the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**.

In an embodiment, the device-driven non-intermediated blockchain configured digital ecosystem  **600**  (referred to as blockchain configured digital ecosystem  **600**  interchangeably without limitations) configured to create the social integrity network  **602**  may power health information exchange facilities and reduce or eliminate the friction and costs of intermediaries. The blockchain configured digital ecosystem  **600**  provides a secured, disintermediated and distributed framework to amplify and support integration of healthcare information across a range of uses and stakeholders defined by the entity. In accordance with an embodiment, the blockchain configured digital ecosystem  **600**  may not require human operators and all participants (entity and associated computers and devices) may have access to distributed ledgers to maintain a secure exchange without brokered trust. The blockchain configured digital ecosystem  **600**  makes the system more efficient and involves lower costs because of disintermediation. The blockchain configured digital ecosystem  **600**  may facilitate a secured and distributed framework for patient digital identities which may use private and public keys secured through cryptography and thus protecting patient identity by allowing a restricted access to a particular entity in accordance with dynamic rules and policies as discussed earlier herein. The distributed nature of the blockchain configured digital ecosystem  **600**  enables shared data which may provide near real-time updates across the social integrity network  **602**  to all the entities  **102**. A smart contracting consistent with rules-based methods as defined earlier such as in accordance with (a) to (e) without limitations may be executed to accessing patient data that can be permissioned to selected entities.

FIG. 7, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 6, illustrates an architecture for enabling health care transactions and accessing of the social records or health records by the entities  **102**  in accordance with the blockchain capable digital ecosystem  **600**  as discussed in conjunction with FIG. 6. At least some embodiments for enabling various health care transactions are discussed herein in conjunction with FIGS. 6 and 7.

The blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  may provide a private view referred to as private data store  **702**  so that each entity  **102**  can privately access and allow others to access certain medical records as appropriate and authorized based on various policies such as based on (a) to (e) without limitations. Each of the entities  **102**  may access the medical records through the dedicated private store  **702**  available through the distributed blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  which may be enabled in the form of distributed blocks as shown in FIG. 7, with each block providing a facility to access the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  by multiple entities at the same time based on defined and granted access rights through the blockchain configured multi-faceted social health care component  **604**. The various medical records as accessible by the entities  **102**  may be aggregated from the entities  **102**  and respective computing devices and extracted from various devices, sensors, social aware networks, wearables, IoT devices, or provided directly by humans as patient inputs, healthcare provider inputs, diagnostic center's inputs, caretaker inputs, insurance agency's inputs, and the like without limitations such as discussed already in conjunction with FIG. 6.

The private data store  **702**  may provide a virtual storage to facilitate interaction, information exchange, and presentation of stored health records according to granted access for an entity. For example, while the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  and blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  may store entire health records in a distributed manner, the private data store  **702**  allows a virtual storage of only limited records out of the entire health records in accordance with permissions granted to entity  **102**. The virtual view of the health records in the private data store  **702**  may behave like a distributed relational database referencing to the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  and the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**. The private data store  **702**  may be configured to auto-hash healthcare interaction at any required interval. This compartmentalization of the health records ensures that the medical records are secured and private as per access rights authorized by owners of the medical records. The data presented on the private data store  **702**  of the blockchain serves as a secure way to ensure that the private data store  **702**  is in sync with any permissioned entity's medical records stored in the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  and blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606** , and as a way for trusted third-parties (entities  **102** ) to discover when there are new medical records that are relevant to the accounts they are entitled and authorized to monitor.

In accordance with an exemplary use case of the current embodiment, a patient may enter his/her health records into the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  by accessing the blockchain configured multi-faceted social health care component  **604**  or the health records may extracted from associated devices, sensors, scanners, and networks, and moved into the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  and respective blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**. The blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  may broadcast this update of the health records to relevant and authorized entities with a pointer to the health records. The authorized entities such as a care provider may access the health records and annotate further based on device information extracted from the sensors  **120**  and devices  **122**. For example, the care provider may note pollution related information in a patient's area as obtained from a pollution sensor and update treatment plans. These updates from the care provider may be broadcasted by the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  to relevant and authorized entities with a pointer to the updates. The authorized entities such as the patient may access the information and drive his/her treatments accordingly. In an example, any entity may initiate sharing of information through a key exchange to retrieve a shared secret to decrypt the health records and can read authorized health records from the private data store  **702**.

In an embodiment, the blockchain configured digital ecosystem  **600**  may provide a federated blockchain consisting of several entities  **102**  and associated computers and devices and sensors that jointly create the health records or social records and attempts to process transfers of data through a trusted, secured and distributed network of the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**. Such entities  **102**  can include patients, care takers, care providers, regulators, payers, and the like. Federations can be organized by systems of care such as identified by geography, e.g. community or state. Patients may be assumed to stay within these systems of care that cross organizations. In an example, the federated blockchain may be applied on top of an existing health information exchange community as a way to further reduce costs and help the community reach financial sustainability.

In accordance with an embodiment, the entities  **102**  can access the health record based on authorization and access rights granted which may dynamically be updated in accordance with embodiments as discussed elsewhere in the document. The blockchain validation device  **610**  may be configured to validate identity of an entity such as  **102**  1 accessing the health records to establish a trusted information exchange and interaction. The blockchain validation device  **610**  may utilize a variety of identity validation algorithms and schemes such as but not limited to facial expressions, geographical coordinates, geo-tags, gestures, muscle activity, and the like. In accordance with a specific type of validation scheme utilized by the blockchain validation device  **610** , a validation scheme-based device may be utilized. Two embodiments, in particular, are discussed herein in conjunction with FIG. 6 that provide for the use of geo-tagging and facial expression for validation of the identity of the entities  **102**.

In an embodiment, the blockchain validation device  **610**  may obtain geographical coordinates associated with an entity  **102**  1 from a global position system (GPS)-based device  **126**. The blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  may tag the medical records associated with entity  **102**  1 using geo-tags to establish a geographical identity with the health records and entity  **102**  1. The geo-tags may be used to validate identity of entity  **102**  1 as well as identity of authorized users to gain access of the health records at least in part. For example, a patient may reside in a particular state of the United States as noted from the patient's demographic information stored in the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**. However, if the GPS-based device  **126**  sends geographical coordinates that indicate another location remote from the United States, the blockchain configured validation device  **610**  may establish a conflict and may not authorize to ingest the medical records coming from a conflicting geography. The blockchain configured validation device  **610**  may instruct the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  which may eventually inform the patient for the conflicting information. If the patient is able to satisfy validation and authorization requirements, the medical records may then be accepted or else may remain suspended until the requirements are met. The blockchain configured validation device  **610**  may include a geo-tagging device  **612**  which may perform geo-tagging of the medical records and also compare the geo-tags with pre-stored information about the patient for processing validation.

In an embodiment, the blockchain validation device  **610**  may extract information pertaining to facial expressions of an entity  **102**  1 such as a patient from an associated facial expression sensor  **614**. The facial expression sensor  **614**  may be of a variety of types to identify and sense a variety of facial expressions as discussed above without limitations. The sensed facial expressions may be communicated to the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  which may be used by a facial expression validation device  **616**  of the blockchain configured validation device  **610**  to perform processing of the sensed facial expressions and evaluate genuineness in accordance with predefined facial patterns.

The facial expression sensor  **614**  (also referred to as face recognition sensor  **614**  interchangeably) may perform automatic face recognition for surveillance, security, authentication or verification purposes of the entities  **102**. Information detected by the facial expression sensor  **614**  may not only expose sensation or passion of a person but can also be used to judge his/her mental views and psychosomatic aspects. The facial expression sensor  **614**  may employ one or more of different techniques such as motion-based approach, muscle-based approach or any other approach without limitations. These approaches may such as involve analysis of aspects originating from bones, tissues, skin, muscles, deformities, contractions, expansions, and so on. The facial expression sensor  **614**  may sense the information and transmit the sensed information to the facial expression-based validation device of the blockchain validation device  **610**  so that the blockchain validation device  **610**  may identify and verify entity  **102**  1 interacting with the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  based on pre-defined parameters signifying complex facial expressions for genuineness and fraud. These pre-defined parameters and related details may be stored in a memory circuit associated with the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  or the blockchain validation device  **610**.

In various embodiments, the information sources (or data sources) accessing and interaction with the blockchain configured multi-faceted social healthcare component  **604**  may generate information or the social records or the medical records or the health records (used interchangeably) and input the information into the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  and the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**. The information sources can be of two types—on chain data sources  **802**  and off chain data sources  **804**  as illustrated in FIG. 8, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 7. The on chain data sources  **802**  may generate standardized information that may directly be saved on the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  in the form of standardized and templatized information. Such information may include patient demographic information  **806** , details or demographic information about healthcare providers  **808** , standard treatments and health plans  **810** , and the like. The off chain data sources  **804**  may generate abstract information that may not be fully or even partially standardized. This type of information may be maintained through relational links  **812**  so that the information may be stored externally while the relational links  **812**  may be maintained by the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  and the blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**. In this manner, the relational links  **812**  may facilitate cross-referencing of the health records or stored information and may redirect any access to the external storage. The off chain data sources  **804**  may generate information such as expansive notes  **814**  that may not be standardized, for example annotations added by a doctor, diagnostic scans  **816**  such as generated by the scanner, genomics data  **818**  involving gene sequencing etc., device information  **820**  coming from sensors and medical devices or wearables which may not follow a particular format, and the like.

FIG. 9, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 8, illustrates another view of a portion of the digital ecosystem  **600**  illustrating multiple entities  **102**  _a_,  **102**  _b_,  **102**  _c_, and  **102**  _d _(together  **102** ); respective associated computing systems  **902**  _a_,  **902**  _b_,  **902**  _c_, and  **902**  _d_; respective associated wearable health monitoring devices  **904**  _a_,  **904**  _b_,  **904**  _c_, and  **904**  _d_; respective associated GPS-based devices  **906**  _a_,  **906**  _b_,  **906**  _c_, and  **906**  _d_; respective associated social networks  **908**  _a_,  **908**  _b_,  **908**  _c_, and  **908**  _d_; respective associated scanners  **910**  _a_,  **910**  _b_,  **910**  _c_, and  **910**  _d_; respective associated sensors  **912**  _a_,  **912**  _b_,  **912**  _c_, and  **912**  _d _communicating with the plurality of blockchain configured social federation proxy  **606**  _a_,  **606**  _b_,  **606**  _c_, and  **606**  _d _and the blockchain configured SHRDB  **608**  for health information management as discussed in accordance with various embodiment discussed in the document.

The blockchain enabled digital ecosystem  **600**  may facilitate a slidechain that may allow for multiple valid branches or entities or devices or networks to propagate simultaneously with a customized set of protocol rules embedded in and applied to each such participant in the chain that branch from another chain. The digital ecosystem provides a computer-implemented system for accessing, developing and maintaining a decentralized database through a peer-to-peer network, to preserve the original state of data inputs while adapting to changing circumstances, user preferences, and emerging technological capabilities.

The security of the blockchain-enabled digital ecosystem is increased by implementing it on a distributed integrity network. A large number of participants and entities all have access to the blockchain and all attempts to add blocks to the chain by finding a key that produces a valid hash for a given block of data. Blockchains on a distributed network with sufficiently restrictive rules for creating valid blocks are fairly secure against unauthorized changes to the data stored in them. This makes blockchains particularly useful for recording healthcare transactions.

In an example, the embodiments herein provide a computer program product configured to include a pre-configured set of instructions, which when performed, can result in actions as stated in conjunction with the method(s) described above. In an example, the pre-configured set of instructions can be stored on a tangible non-transitory computer readable medium. In an example, the tangible non-transitory computer readable medium can be configured to include the set of instructions, which when performed by a device, can cause the device to perform acts similar to the ones described here.

The embodiments herein may comprise a computer program product configured to include a pre-configured set of instructions, which when performed, can result in actions as stated in conjunction with the methods described above. In an example, the pre-configured set of instructions can be stored on a tangible non-transitory computer readable medium or a program storage device. In an example, the tangible non-transitory computer readable medium can be configured to include the set of instructions, which when performed by a device, can cause the device to perform acts similar to the ones described here. Embodiments herein may also include tangible and/or non-transitory computer-readable storage media for carrying or having computer executable instructions or data structures stored thereon.

Generally, program modules include routines, programs, components, data structures, objects, and the functions inherent in the design of special-purpose processors, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Computer executable instructions, associated data structures, and program modules represent examples of the program code means for executing steps of the methods disclosed herein. The particular sequence of such executable instructions or associated data structures represents examples of corresponding acts for implementing the functions described in such steps.

The techniques provided by the embodiments herein may be implemented on an integrated circuit chip (not shown). The chip design is created in a graphical computer programming language, and stored in a computer storage medium (such as a disk, tape, physical hard drive, or virtual hard drive such as in a storage access network). If the designer does not fabricate chips or the photolithographic masks used to fabricate chips, the designer transmits the resulting design by physical means (e.g., by providing a copy of the storage medium storing the design) or electronically (e.g., through the Internet) to such entities, directly or indirectly. The stored design is then converted into the appropriate format (e.g., GDSII) for the fabrication of photolithographic masks, which typically include multiple copies of the chip design in question that are to be formed on a wafer. The photolithographic masks are utilized to define areas of the wafer (and/or the layers thereon) to be etched or otherwise processed.

The resulting integrated circuit chips can be distributed by the fabricator in raw wafer form (that is, as a single wafer that has multiple unpackaged chips), as a bare die, or in a packaged form. In the latter case the chip is mounted in a single chip package (such as a plastic carrier, with leads that are affixed to a motherboard or other higher level carrier) or in a multichip package (such as a ceramic carrier that has either or both surface interconnections or buried interconnections). In any case the chip is then integrated with other chips, discrete circuit elements, and/or other signal processing devices as part of either (a) an intermediate product, such as a motherboard, or (b) an end product. The end product can be any product that includes integrated circuit chips, ranging from toys and other low-end applications to advanced computer products having a display, a keyboard or other input device, and a central processor.

The embodiments herein can include both hardware and software elements. The embodiments that are implemented in software include but are not limited to, firmware, resident software, microcode, etc.

A data processing system suitable for storing and/or executing program code will include at least one processor coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus. The memory elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code, bulk storage, and cache memories which provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution.

Input/output (I/O) devices (including but not limited to keyboards, displays, pointing devices, etc.) can be coupled to the system either directly or through intervening I/O controllers. Network adapters may also be coupled to the system to enable the data processing system to become coupled to other data processing systems or remote printers or storage devices through intervening private or public networks. Modems, cable modem and Ethernet cards are just a few of the currently available types of network adapters.
