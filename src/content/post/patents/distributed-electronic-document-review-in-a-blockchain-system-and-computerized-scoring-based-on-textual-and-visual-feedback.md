1. Technical Field

The embodiments herein generally relate to electronic document validation, and more particularly to crowdsourced electronic document review and scoring utilizing textual as well as visual feedback from reviewers.

2. Description of the Related Art

Many organizations give financial aid and rewards such as grants, etc. for valuable ideas. However, in many cases, the organizations are not always sure about how to choose the most valuable ideas out of a set of innumerable ideas submitted for evaluation. Furthermore, many times the feedback may not be textual and therefore merely relying on textual feedback and review comments may not be sufficient for proper evaluation. This makes the evaluation process difficult and even less reliable by these organizations.

Therefore, there is a need for a method and system for electronic documents review and scoring based on different types of visual and textual reviews from verified and reliable sources.

FIG. 1 illustrates generally but not by the way of limitation, among other things, an exemplary ecosystem  **100**  in which various embodiments may operate. The ecosystem  **100**  may facilitate implementation of an expertise driven review and scoring system (also referred to as electronic document review and scoring system, EDRS)  **102**  of electronic documents in a crowdsourced network  **106**. The ecosystem  **100**  may include a server computer  **108**  connected to the electronic document review and scoring (EDRS) system  **102**. The EDRS system  **102**  may include an expert attributes assessment engine  **110** , an expert scoring module  **112** , and a document scoring module  **114**. The ecosystem  **100**  may further include a processing circuit  **116**  coupled to the EDRS system  **102**. The ecosystem  **100**  may further include a memory circuit  **118**  coupled to the processing circuit  **116**.

In an embodiment, the ecosystem  **100**  facilitates crowdsourced document review and scoring electronically by a plurality of crowdsourced experts or reviewers. The plurality of reviewers may be shortlisted based on a set of attributes in order to define assessment and evaluation criteria for the documents that results in associating a final score to the documents. The attributes may be defined and considered by the expert attributes engine  **110**. The attributes may include for example, crowdsourced credentialing, crowdsourcing index, officiality, reputation, and the like without limitations. The crowdsourced credentialing may be indicative of a degree of credentialing by a plurality of respondents, for example it may be indicative of a score obtained by the expert or reviewer on the basis of credentialing of the expert or an expert profile by a plurality of respondents. The crowdsourcing index may be indicative of the level of crowdsourcing that is the number of respondents credentialing the expert. In an embodiment, the effect of crowdsourcing index for an expert may bear a non-linear relationship of number of respondents credentialing an expert with a score of an expert thus obtained. For example, the relationship can be exponential. The officiality may be indicative of a position held by an expert at an organization. The reputation may be indicative of how much an organization or a community trusts an expert.

In examples, each of the attributes may be assigned specific weights. The process of assignment of weights to the attributes of the experts may depend on parameters for example, including without limitations, document type, document complexity, experts profiles, location and country of the expert, significance and objectives of review and scoring, and the like. In an example, the highest weight is assigned to officiality, then to credentialed expertise, then to reputation, and so on.

The expert scoring module  **112**  may facilitate cumulative scoring of an expert based on the defined attributes and assessment of the expert on each of the defined attributes as performed by the attributes engine  **110**. For example, the scoring module  **112**  may associate a score to an expert based on cumulative ranking of an expert for each of the attributes with a consideration of the respective weightages for the attributes. The expert scoring module  **112**  may include various sub modules or engines that may facilitate in evaluation of an expert's score based on each of the respective attributes. For example, as will be discussed later, the expert scoring module may include a credentialing system, reputation assessment engine, officiality engine, and the like.

The document scoring module  **114**  associates a score to the document based on an associated cumulative score based on respective scores of the crowdsourced reviewers/experts as determined by the expert scoring module  **112**. The cumulative score determined from the respective scores of the plurality of crowdsourced experts may factor in the effect of crowdsourcing by using the expert crowdsourcing index that may result in a non-linear effect on the final cumulative score. In an embodiment, the crowdsourcing index may be defined statistically for various number of experts reviewing a document. For example, within a range of 1-20, a crowdsourcing index 1 may be used as a multiplier for considering the crowdsourcing impact. For a range of 21-40, a crowdsourcing index of 1.2 may be used. For a range of 41-60, a crowdsourcing index of 1.5 may be used. In other examples, the crowdsourcing index may be determined dynamically with an increase in the effect with each added crowdsourced expert in the review process. In such cases, a mathematical relationship may be defined for determining the crowdsourcing index. The relationship may for example be an exponential increase in the value of the crowdsourcing index with an increase in the number of experts included in the review process.

The memory circuit  **118**  stores a plurality of common profiles associated with a plurality of crowdsourced experts. The memory circuit  **118**  further stores a plurality of federated profiles associated with each of the common profiles. In an example, the federated and common profiles are created based on a plurality of federated sources distributed across the crowdsourced network  **106**. The federated and common profiles will be discussed later.

The processing circuit  **116**  includes various processing components and is capable of performing processing tasks for aggregating profiles, federating common profiles, scoring and rating experts, assessing review of the documents, scoring of the documents and various other tasks as discussed throughout this document. In an example, the processing circuit  **116**  may include or be coupled to the expert attributes engine  **110** , expert scoring module  **112**  and document scoring module  **114**  for performing these and various other tasks.

In an example, the crowdsourced network may be a blockchain configured social integrity network so that the experts or reviewers or participants are connected with the blockchain configured social integrity network through distributed access points that serve as access to various systems and sub-systems of the ecosystem  **100**  in a distributed fashion for all participants to manage, share, edit, annotate and review documents in parallel within authorized access rules.

The blockchain configured ecosystem and associated components, also referred to as a "smart contract based distributed integrity network", may not require a centralized information exchange (IE) operator because all participants may have access to distributed ledgers to maintain a secure exchange without broken trusts. This allows disintermediation by removing human participants from a chain of the participants such as entities. Additionally, the documents for review are distributed across a plurality of storage locations in the blockchain accessible by the participants simultaneously and allowing to make updates and review them almost in real time. The blockchain configured ecosystem provides a secured, disintermediated and distributed framework to amplify and support integration of information across a range of uses and stakeholders defined by the entities. The blockchain configured digital ecosystem facilitates a secured and distributed framework for patient digital identities to allow access to body worn personally connected health devices, connected health devices at home and other facilities, storage devices and servers hosting the documents and the like, with the use of private and public keys secured through cryptography and thus protecting identity of a participant or reviewer by allowing a restricted access to a particular entity in accordance with dynamic rules and policies along with strong identity validation mechanisms using blockchain configured validation devices across the integrity network. The distributed nature of the blockchain configured digital ecosystem enables shared data which provides near real-time updates across a network accessible to all authorized entities without the need for a centralized authority or exchange. The blockchain configured ecosystem is discussed further in conjunction with subsequent figures.

FIG. 2, with reference to FIG. 1, illustrates generally, but not by the way of limitation, among other things, an exemplary operating environment for crowdsourced credentialing of the experts. The environment includes a plurality of experts  **202**  a - **202**  d (together referred to as  **202** ) and a plurality of respondents  **204**  a - **204**  c (together referred to as  **204** ) connected in a crowdsourced network  **106**. A credentialing system  **206**  is connected with the network  **106**  and is accessible by the experts  **202**  and the respondents  **204**  through the network  **106**  using for example a web-based interface or portal (not shown in FIG. 2).

The network  **106**  can employ a wireline or a wired communication channel or both. The wireless communications network may include for example, but not limited to, a digital cellular network, such as Global System for Mobile Telecommunications (GSM) network, Personal Communication System (PCS) network, or any other wireless communications network. The wire line communications network may include for example, but not limited to, a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), proprietary local and long distance communications network, or any other wire line communications network. In addition, the network  **106**  may include for example, digital data networks, such as one or more local area networks (LANS), one or more wide area networks (WANS), or both LANS and WANS to allow interaction with the credentialing system  **206**. One or more networks may be included in the crowdsourced network  **106**  and may include both public networks such as the Internet, and private networks and may utilize any networking technology and protocol, such as Ethernet, Token Ring, Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), or the like to allow interaction with the credentialing system  **206**. In an embodiment, the network  **106**  can be a blockchain configured social integrity network.

The experts  **202**  can include one or more of a physician, doctor, surgeon, healthcare expert, any other healthcare professional, or any other professional or expert from other industry such as energy, financial, transportation, logistics, and numerous other industries. The respondents  **204**  may include one or more of a physician, doctor, surgeon, healthcare expert, any other healthcare professional or healthcare organization such as a hospital, or any other professional or expert from other industry such as energy, financial, transportation, logistics, and numerous other industries, or any other person who may be interested in credentialing or accreditation process of the experts  **202**  or may be any person related to the experts  **202**  and who may provide a trusted response or comment on information about the experts  **202**  such as qualifications, work history and the like. A plurality of industry-related or other agencies such as hospitals, nursing centers, research institutes, financial companies, financial agencies, transportation agencies, energy related agencies, and others or hiring agencies or placement agencies may also access the system  **206**  to receive credentialing or verification services provided by the system  **206**  for the plurality of experts  **202**. In such embodiments, the system  **206**  may provide the services to such agencies based on credentialing of the information of the experts  **202**  obtained by the respondents  **204**.

The experts  **202**  and respondents  **204**  may be connected with, for example, any type of electronic data processing system or communication device or a client device connected to the communications network. Examples of such an electronic data processing system or client device may include personal computer systems, such as desktop or laptop computers, workstation computer systems, server computer systems, networks of computer systems, personal digital assistants (PDAs), wireless communications devices, portable electronic devices, smartphones, tablets, or any other electronic data processing system. The client devices or data processing systems can include hardware/software computing devices capable of computational tasks associated with profile creation, modification, verification, and presentation and the like as will be discussed later. These tasks can be performed through stand alone application, via Web browser graphical user interface (GUI), or via a Rich Internet Interface (RII). An embodiment herein may be implemented as computer software incorporated as part of an online social networking system. An embodiment herein may be implemented as distributed blockchain configured architecture. The credentialing system  **206**  can operate with the client device using a Windows, Macintosh, UNIX, Linux or other operating system equipped with a Web browser application, or other Web-enabled device capable of connecting to the crowdsourced network  **106**.

The credentialing system  **206**  provides a technical capability and a federation model such that profiles of the experts  **202**  may be created including details about the experts  **202**  and stored in the system  **206**. The details may include demographic information, personal information, educational background, work history or any other similar information. These profiles can be shared with the plurality of respondents  **204**  and experts  **202**  based on set standards and preferences and rules to implement a federated exchange capability wherein distinct portions of the profiles can be credentialed or accredited or verified and shared or exchanged with the experts  **202**  or respondents  **204**  in a federated manner. The system  **206**  further provides a credentialing and verification and accreditation capability such that profiles of each of the experts  **202**  may be credentialed or verified or accredited by any other expert or the respondents  **204**  for the use of the credentialed profiles by other experts  **202**  or an agency or organization such that the entire credentialed information or profiles available and credentialed through federated sources is accessible at a single location from the system  **206**  across distributed and connected access points in the blockchain configured architecture. In some embodiments, the system  **206**  further provides a capability to create a federated model of the profiles such that the federated segments or portions or profiles, as will be discussed later in detail, may be verified or credentialed distinctly by distinct federated respondents  **204**  in the crowdsourced network  **106**  such that the crowdsourcing increases the level of trust and authenticity and reliability of the credentialing and credentialed information due to cumulative effect of several federated verifications by the crowdsourced respondents  **204**  for the same segments of the profiles.

The credentialing system  **206**  as shown includes a federated profile manager  **208** , a segmenting or federation engine  **210** , and a certification engine  **212**  discussed below in detail.

The federated profile manager  **208**  is configured to receive information for profile creation from the plurality of experts  **202**. The federated profile manager  **208**  is responsible for maintaining the information thus received from the experts  **202**  and modify it as per updates from the experts  **202**. The federated profile manager  **208**  is configured to be linked to several sources of information that have the experts' presence such as for example their social networks including social networking websites, their educational institutions, work environments and the like. The federated profile manager  **208**  collects information from a plurality of sources for each of the experts  **202**  and collates the records and information in the form of a single common profile of each of the experts  **202**  that are associated with and communicate with the system  **206**. The profile manager  **208** , for example may collect information from federated sources such as Linkedin, Myspace, About.Me, education institutions, workstations, and the like. The common profile maintained by the system  **206**  may be viewable by the experts  **202** , respondents  **204** , relevant organizations, or any other persons or entities associated with or subscribed to the system  **206**. In some embodiments, the experts  **202** , respondents  **204** , relevant organizations, or any other persons or entities may access the distributed access points of the blockchain configured architecture for simultaneous near-real-time management of review process. In some embodiments, the federated profile manager  **208**  may automatically retrieve the profile information from the social networks. In some embodiments, the federated profile manager  **208**  may maintain information that is submitted by the experts  **202**  voluntarily.

The federated profile manager  **208**  may allow the experts  **202**  to maintain their profiles in the system  **206**  and protect the information in their profiles and their attention from inappropriate access, and makes their personal profiles connectable. The credentialing system  **206**  may further enable the profiles and information therein as searchable by the experts  **202**  and the respondents  **204**. In doing so, the experts  **202**  may use a web-based interface to access the user interface or portal of the system  **206**. The experts  **202**  can then create their profiles and update profile information using the user interface after an initial registration process. To register, the experts  **202**  may complete a registration form and enter a valid email address as a unique identifier, and a private password. The experts  **202**  may then set up their profiles and enter the information. The profile describes the user's background, experience, current and prior interests, capabilities, positions and titles, skills, values, projects, goals, employing organizations, working stations etc. The experts  **202**  can add contacts by entering contact and relationship information, and profile information for the contact, or a link to the contact's own profile on the system  **206**. The contact information may also be automatically uploaded or extracted from other sources such as an electronic address book, and authorized by the experts  **202**  for use in the credentialing system  **206**. The experts  **202**  may not want their address book integrated in the system  **206**. In this case, the experts' address book would be uploaded, but not integrated into the credentialing system  **106**  and possibly hidden from others. The profiles and contact information may be stored in either a central database or in distributed databases. For example, the system  **206**  may include or be coupled to a profiles database  **214**  that may store the information pertinent to the profiles of the experts  **202**.

In some embodiments, once an expert  **202**  a joins the network  **106**  and subscribes with the credentialing system  **206** , the information included in the profiles is ready for credentialing, verification, accreditation, or any other such purpose. The entire profiles can thus be credentialed or verified by the system  **206**  from the plurality of crowdsourced respondents  **204**  such that the crowdsourced respondents  **204**  can verify the profiles and credential them. The credentialing may also determine the profiles as accurate or inaccurate, trustable or non-trustable, authentic or unauthentic, fraud or genuine, etc.

In other embodiments, once the plurality of experts  **202**  join the network  **106** , the profiles are segmented into distinct portions or segments referred to as federated profiles by the federation or segmenting engine  **210**. The segmenting engine  **210**  is configured to receive the common profiles from the profile manager  **208**  and segment them into the federated portions or segments or profiles. In an example, the federation engine  **210**  fragments a common profile of an expert into a plurality of federated profiles based on commonalities in content of the federated profiles. The federated profiles are treated as distinct profiles for the purpose of credentialing separately by the crowdsourced respondents  **204**. For example, a common profile P of the professional expert  **202**  a may include the following details:

-

  - Age: 38 years
  - Sex: Male
  - Location: Texas, US

For the purpose of simplicity of description, only some specific details are included as an example in the above profile, however several other details may also be included without limitations. The segmenting engine  **210**  may be configured to segment the profile into distinct federated profiles. For example, in some embodiments, the above common profile may be segmented by the segmenting engine  **210**  into several federated profiles as below:

As discussed above, a single common profile is segmented by the segmenting engine  **210**  in thirty-five discrete federated profiles that are distinct in one or the other ways. In accordance with various embodiments, the segmenting engine  **210**  can be configured to segment a common profile in as many discrete federated profiles as possible. Therefore, the entire information contained in a common profile is segmented into several discrete federated profiles. For example, the above discussed common profile is converted into thirty-five such federated profiles. Upon segmenting, the federated profiles may be communicated to the federated profile manager  **208**. Thus, the federated profile manager  **208**  stores common profiles as well as federated profiles associated with the professionals or experts  **202**  in the profiles database  **214**.

The segmenting engine  **210**  may include hardware and software components capable of computational tasks associated with segmenting of the common profiles into the federated profiles. Once segmented by the segmenting engine  **210** , the federated profile manager  **208**  may further classify the federated profiles or segments into groups of federated profiles for the same experts  **202**  so that the groups may include similar federated profiles based on certain parameters. For example, the work experience related federated profiles segments 27, 30, and 33 that define different companies where an expert was employed and is employed may be grouped together do define another type of profile referred to herein as a sub-profile. Similarly, various other groups may be formed to create various other sub-profiles based on several possible combinations of the federated profiles or segments or profile portions. The credentialing system  **206**  thus can facilitate maintaining of the common profiles, sub-profiles and the federated profiles for the same experts thus providing a three level profile management facility. It must be appreciated that this document uses the term portion, segment and federated profile interchangeably without limitations.

The credentialing system  **206**  further includes the certification engine  **212**  coupled to the segmentation engine  **210**  and the federated profile manager  **208**. The certification engine  **212**  is configured to allow the plurality of crowdsourced respondents  **204**  to respond to the segmented and classified profiles associated with the plurality of experts  **202**  and credential them. The credentialing of each of the segmented portions or federated profiles associated with an expert  **202**  a of the plurality of experts  **202**  contributes to credentialing of the entire profile of the expert  **202**  a upon collation of the credentialed portions. For example, the exemplary profile as discussed above includes thirty-five segments. The credentialing of each of the segments influences overall credentialing of the entire common profile. Therefore, if all the thirty-five segments are credentialed and verified as correct by one or more respondents  **204** , a trust may be associated about the profile information and the information may be considered as true or authentic. As more and more persons or respondents from the plurality of crowdsourced respondents  **204**  verify the information in the federated profiles, the trust associated with the respective segments increases. Further, the crowdsourcing index may be associated to indicate and factor in the level of crowdsourcing. In an example, the crowdsourcing index may bear a non-linear such as exponential relationship with the number of respondents crowdsourcing an expert. Therefore, the degree of reliability and trust may increase non-linearly as more and more respondents credential an expert. Therefore, the crowdsourcing may facilitate in credentialing more accurately and with a higher reliability of the federated profiles than that credentialed from only a few sources. Further, the overall accuracy of the common profile may be determined based on a cumulative effect of accuracy of each of the federated profiles. For example, if the first ten of the segments from the above common profile are verified and the remaining twenty-five segments are not verified due to no response from the respondents  **204** , this may not yield an overall high accuracy of the common profile and may still require credentialing and verification of the remaining segments but may be considered as acceptable to a certain extent. On the contrary, if the remaining twenty-five segments are rejected and verified as wrong information by the respondents  **204** , the overall common profile may be considered as inaccurate. Further, since the discrete federated profiles associated with an expert  **202**  a are credentialed from the plurality of crowdsourced respondents  **204** , there may be a high level of accuracy in the credentialing and the credentialing may be considered as highly authentic and reliable.

The certification engine  **212**  is adapted certify the stored federated profiles relating to the experts  **202**  such as physicians, engineers, or other industry experts who must have their credentials verified for use by various agencies or for use in for example by the experts  **202**  themselves during filling and submission of forms to various companies for such as hiring purposes or other purposes or document review processes. The credentialing information related to a particular expert  **202**  a desiring to use the embodiments herein is initially input in the form of a common profile and then segmented and credentialed separately for each of the federated profiles through the crowdsourced network of the plurality of respondents  **204**. Therefore, the credentialing information, when credentialed for each of the federated profiles, is more accurate and valid and acceptable than the common profile verified in entirety where special attention may not be paid to every record of the common profile. Secondly, the degree of acceptance of credentialing information is much higher through crowdsourcing than for a single verification by a single source. Therefore, according to some embodiments herein, the number of sources credentialing a particular federated profile may be associated with each of the segments to indicate a level of accuracy of the credentialing information. For example, if a federated profile is credentialed and verified by eighteen sources in the network, it may be considered as highly acceptable. Also, the relevant information about credentialing such as who credentialed, when credentialed may also be associated with each credentialing of each of the segments so that an authenticity may be judged by associating an overall impact of the federated profiles' credentialing, number of times credentialed, and trust factor about the source who verified and relevance about the time when verified. Therefore, in such embodiments, a multi-scaled and cumulative score may be determined and multi-scaled and cumulative credentialing may be done based on the multi-scaled cumulative score determined. Further, since a single federated profile may be verified by the plurality of crowdsourced respondents  **204** , therefore the credentialing system  **206**  may determine an extent of inconsistency between several credentialing by several different respondents  **204**  for the same federated profile. In this manner, the system  **206**  may be configured to determine an index of inconsistency depending on distribution of differences across several credentialing by the several respondents  **204**. The credentialing system  **206**  may be configured to generate a map indicating extent and coverage of inconsistencies among the several responses and credentialing for the same federated profiles. The map together with the inconsistency index may facilitate in determination of a level of trust in the overall credentialing of the same federated profile. This process may be repeated for each of the federated profiles for a common profile of an expert such as  **202**  a and thus may determine an overall index of inconsistency and overall distribution map and overall trust factor for the common profile.

In some embodiments, various organizations or agencies such as for example document reviewing and inventions or ideas evaluation agencies may use the credentialing information, index of inconsistency, and distribution map as obtained from the system  **206**. The credentialing information may include information such as who verified or credentialed, when verified, how many times verified, how many different and unique verifications, trust factor associated with each verification based on such as a respondent's relationship with an expert such as  **202**  a or any other factor, and other similar information. In some embodiments, the credentialing information may be used by the experts  **202**  themselves so that they can use the credentialing information as a proof of expertise and submit it along with various application forms to companies, hiring agencies, firms, healthcare centers, hospitals or any other agency or organization belonging to various energy sectors. Various types of information such as demographic, personal work history, educational information, affiliation with hospitals or institutes etc. can be credentialed. The credentialed information may include such as person's name, address, practice specialties, appointment status, associations, credentials (including educational background, internships, and residency programs), state licensing information, malpractice liability insurance information, and personal and professional references. This entire information may be stored in the profiles database  **214**  maintained by the federated profile manager  **208**.

In some embodiments, the certification engine  **212**  may be coupled to or may include a profiles certification database  **216**. The profiles certification database  **216**  may include the credentialing information as discussed above. In some embodiments, the profiles certification database  **216**  may be included within the profiles database  **214**  only, and thus a single database may include memory spaces for storing the profiles information and the certification or credentialing information.

In some embodiments, in creating the common profile and uploading profile information in the database, a separate application form may be completed for each professional participating in and using the benefits of the system  **206**. The information in the application form may be preferably provided to the profiles database  **214** , which may store experts' profile information using the system  **206**. The information may be stored as a series of logically organized experts' profiles and may be extracted as necessary during segmentation by the segmenting engine  **210**. In some embodiments, the process of segmenting may be initiated by the segmenting engine  **210**  automatically as and when new information is added or updated. In case the past information is modified, the segmentation task is performed again to update the federated profiles and perform credentialing of the updated federated profiles once again. In such cases, only relevant credentialing may be needed to be revised depending on the updates instead of rejecting the entire past federated profiles and credentialing information associated with them.

FIG. 3, with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, illustrates the credentialing system  **206**  in accordance with an embodiment. As shown, the system  **206**  may include a profile management server  **302**  and a profile certification server  **304**. The profile management server  **302**  includes a profile information collection module  **306** , the federated profile manager  **208** , and the profile segmenting engine  **210**.

The profile information collection module  **306**  may be configured to generate information about the plurality of experts  **202**. In some embodiments, the profile information collection module  **306**  can be disposed separately from the federated profile manager  **208** ; while in other embodiments it can be included in or coupled to the federated profile manager  **208**. The profile information pertaining to profiles of the plurality of experts  **202**  can be generated by distributing application forms through a graphical user interface accessible by the experts  **202**  such that the experts  **202**  can fill the forms and submit with the system  **206**. The information can be transformed in the form of profiles by the federated profile manager  **208**. The segmenting engine  **210**  may then use the profiles information and perform the task of segmenting of the common profiles into the federated profiles associated with each of the experts  **202**.

The profile certification server  **304**  may be communicatively coupled to or included in the profile management server  **302**. The profile certification server  **304**  may include the certification engine  **212** , a segment rating engine  **308** , and a profile rating engine  **310**. The certification engine  **212**  may further include a segment certification engine  **312**  and a profile certification engine  **314**.

The segment certification engine  **312**  may be configured to facilitate credentialing or certification of the federated profiles associated with the common profiles associated with each of the experts  **202**. The segment certification engine  **312**  is configured to allow the plurality of crowdsourced respondents  **204**  to respond to the federated profiles associated with the common profiles of the plurality of experts  **202**  and credential them. The credentialing of each of the federated profiles associated with the common profiles of each of the experts  **202**  contributes to credentialing of the entire common profile of the experts  **202**  upon collation of the credentialed federated profiles. As more and more persons or respondents from the plurality of crowdsourced respondents  **204**  verify the information in the federated profiles, the trust associated with credentialing of the respective federated profiles increases. Therefore, the crowdsourcing may allow credentialing of the federated profiles to a higher degree of accuracy and reliability. Since the discrete federated profiles associated with an expert  **202**  are credentialed from the plurality of crowdsourced respondents  **204** , the credentialing defines a high level of accuracy and may be considered as highly authentic and reliable and acceptable by third parties or agencies. Moreover, the crowdsourcing index may be associated to factor in the effect of crowdsourced credentialing as discussed above.

The segment certification engine  **312**  is adapted to certify the stored federated profiles relating to the experts  **202**  who must have their credentials verified. According to some embodiments herein, the number of sources credentialing a particular federated profile may be associated with each of the segments to indicate a level of accuracy of the credentialing information. Also, the relevant information about credentialing such as who credentialed, when credentialed may also be associated with each credentialing of each of the federated profiles so that an authenticity may be judged by associating an overall impact of the federated profiles' credentialing, number of times credentialed, and trust factor about the source who verified and relevance about the source and time when verified. Therefore, in such embodiments, a multi-scaled and cumulative score may be determined and multi-scaled and cumulative credentialing may be done based on the multi-scaled cumulative score determined.

The information pertaining to credentialing of the individual federated profiles of a particular common profile associated with an expert such as  **202**  a may influence an overall credentialing of the common profile. For example, individual credentialing of the federated segments may contribute to the overall common profile credentialing such that the credentialing of the overall common profile may depend on each of the federated profiles' credentialing with a weightage attached to each credentialing of the federated profiles. The collated contribution considering weightage effect of each credentialing finally decides credentialing of the overall common profile. The task of credentialing the overall common profile associated with an expert such as  **202**  a may be performed by the profile certification engine  **314**. For example, the profile certification engine  **314**  may facilitate credentialing of the profile in its entirety based on the collated effect of credentialing of the federated profiles associated with the common profile of an expert such as  **202**  a . The profile certification engine  **314**  may receive information pertinent to credentialing of each of the federated profiles associated with a common profile and then associate the defined weightages to each of the federated profiles and perform cumulative credentialing of the common profile. In an embodiment, the weightages may be determined based on parameters defined by a service provider who operates the system  **206**. In such embodiments, the weightages may be defined based on for example past experiences or current understanding about significance of accuracy of credentialing for different segments. For example, the accuracy of credentialing may be more important for work history than information pertinent to hobbies of a professional when applying for a job. Therefore, the objective use of the credentialing information may influence determination of the weightages and hence the overall credentialing. Therefore, a score indicative of the influence of the objective may be associated for the credentialing purposes in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the weightages may be defined by an agency requiring the credentialing information. Therefore, in such cases, the profile certification engine  **314**  may perform credentialing of the common profile in a custom defined manner and also in association with the objective score.

The profile certification server  **304**  further includes the segment rating engine  **308**. The segment rating engine  **308**  is configured to associate a rating to each of the credentialed federated profiles based on credentialing from the crowdsourced plurality of respondents  **204**  and depending on a level of accuracy and trust associated with the credentialing of the federated profiles. The rating may depend on who credentialed a federated profile, when was a profile credentialed, how many times a profile was credentialed, how many unique credentials are done, relevance of respondents  **204**  credentialing the federated profile, relationship of the respondents  **204**  with the expert such as  **202**  a of the credentialed federated profile, and the like.

The profile certification server  **304**  may further include the profile rating engine  **310**. The profile rating engine  **310**  is configured to associate a rating to an entire profile based on credentialing of each of the federated profiles and ratings associated with each of the federated profiles as determined by the segment rating engine  **208**  cumulatively.

The profile management server  **302**  is coupled to the profiles database  **214**  to store information pertinent to the profiles of the plurality of experts  **202**. The profiles database  **214**  may be coupled to the federated profile manager  **208**  such that the federated profile manager  **208**  maintains the information stored in the profiles database  **214**.

The profile certification server  **304**  may be coupled to the profiles certification database  **216**. The profiles certification database  **216**  is configured to store information pertinent to credentialing such as certification status of the federated or common profiles associated with the plurality of experts  **202**. For example, the certification status may include one or more of verified segment, verified profile, pending verification, verification in progress, segment rejected as incorrect, profile rejected as incorrect and the like. The profiles certification database  **216**  may be coupled to the profiles database  **214**  and the certification engine  **212**.

The profile certification server  **304**  may be coupled to the certified profiles database  **312**. The certified profiles database  **312**  may further be coupled to the profiles certification database  **216**. The certified profiles database  **216**  may be configured to store profiles that have been verified by the certification engine  **212**. An entity or agency may be allowed a direct access to the certified profiles database  **316**  based on preferences and rules defined for the entity or the agency. The entity may be one of a medical entity such as a hospital, nursing center, doctor, physician, healthcare unit, and government healthcare department, or an entity belonging to other industry such as financial sector, energy, transportation and the like or any other third party or agency. The certified profile or credential database  **316**  may further store information pertinent to one or more of work history, education, and personal demographics, affiliations to hospitals or other institutes etc. of one or more experts  **202**  corresponding to one or more of verified profiles.

The profiles database  **214** , profiles certification database  **216** , and the certified profiles database  **312**  may be coupled to a profiles sources database  **314**. The profile sources database  **314**  may include information about a plurality of sources in the crowdsourced network  **106**  that are linked to the federated profiles associated with the plurality of the experts  **202** , and information about a plurality of sources who responds to the federated profiles for credentialing. For example, in the crowdsourced network  **106** , the plurality of respondents  **204**  may credential the federated profiles and thus the profiles sources database  **314**  may store their details, their names, other information, their relevance and relationship with the experts  **202**  associated with the federated profiles they credential and time of credentialing, and location of original credentialing or any other such information pertinent to the credentialing sources etc.

In an example, the profiles database  **214** , profiles certification database  **216** , and the certified profiles database  **312**  may be blockchain configured so as to allow access by the entities (experts  **202**  and respondents  **204** ) or any other agency and associated computing systems through the distributed plurality of access points simultaneously and reflect or view reviews or any changes during review process in near real-time.

FIG. 4, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 3, illustrates another embodiment of the credentialing system  **206**. The credentialing system  **206**  may include the profile management server  **302**  and the profile certification server  **304**  as discussed above. The system  **206**  may further include an auto-validation engine  **402**  coupled to the profile certification server  **304**  and the profile management server  **302**. The auto-validation engine  **402**  is further communicatively linked to a social networking platform  **404**. The social network platform  **404**  hosts information related to one or more of the experts  **202**. For example, the social networking platform  **404**  may host social profiles of the experts  **202**  where the experts  **202**  may store and update their personal, professional or other such details or may communicate in a social network with friends, relatives, family members, or other such networking contacts.

The auto-validation engine  **402**  is configured to further certify the credentialing of the federated profiles that is performed by the certification engine  **212**. The second level certification by the auto-validation engine  **404**  is performed by using the information about the one or more experts  **202**  from the social networking platform  **404**. For example, an expert such as  **202**  a may be associated with a social networking website such as a Linkedin or Facebook. The expert  **202**  a may maintain a separate profile for each such social networking website. The credentialing of the expert  **202**  a for specific federated profiles may thus be further verified by using the information obtained from the social networking profiles.

In an embodiment, the credentialing by the respondents  **204**  is used to associate a rating and define a level of trust for the federated profiles and the common profiles. The further verification based on the information obtained from the social profiles of the experts  **202**  may further associate another rating or score to the federated profiles such that a level of trust about the plurality of experts  **202**  and their federated and common profiles may be determined based on a cumulative effect of credentialing and the auto validation of the federated profiles and the common profiles. The cumulative score determined based on individual scores from the auto validation and the credentialing by the respondents  **204**  may define a net rating and overall credentialing of the federated profiles and the common profiles. The federated profiles and the common profiles in association with the information pertinent to the credentialing and the auto-validation may thus be used or accessed by agencies or organizations or various entities or agencies to determine a level of trust in the credentialed information; i.e., the credentialed federated and thus common profiles.

The auto-validation engine  **402**  may include application programming interfaces (APIs)  **406** , a social networking engine  **408** , and a profile updating module  **410**.

The social networking engine  **408**  is coupled to one or more social networking server  **412**. The social network engine  **408** , which may be controlled by the social network server  **412** , is configured to process a request of the credentialing system  **206**  for retrieving social profiles information and verifying the credentialed federated and common profiles by using the information obtained from the social profiles. The social networking engine  **408**  is communicatively coupled to the social networking platform  **404**  through the social network server  **412**  to allow interfacing of the system  **206**  with the social networking service or platform  **404**. The social network server  **412**  may provide a programmatic web interface via the network  **106**  for accessing the social profiles by the system  **206**. In some embodiments, the social networking server  **412**  may store social data related to the one or more experts  **202**  obtained from the social profiles hosted by the social networking platform  **404**  to integrate the social data with the credentialed federated profiles for further verification or updating of the credentialing by auto-validation.

The social networking engine  **408**  may utilize the APIs  **406**  etc. to allow verification of the federated segments associated with the plurality of experts  **202**  based on the information contained in the social profiles of each of the experts  **202**  maintained by the social networking platform  **404**. In an embodiment, the social profiles maintained by the social networking platform  **404**  are distinct from the federated or common profiles of the professionals or experts  **202**  maintained by the federated profile manager  **208**. The APIs  **406**  further allow the auto-validation to determine an extent of mapping between the information contained in the two distinct profiles maintained by the federated profile manager  **208**  and the social networking platform  **404**. The social networking platform  **404**  may include several social networking sources. The social networking sources may include without limitations social networking websites, educational institutions, employers' databases etc. For example, an expert such as  **202**  a may be associated with one or more of such or other similar social networking sources in the social networking platform  **404**. The APIs  **406**  are adapted to link each of the federated profiles to one or more such distinct sources of the social networking platform  **404**  such that a unique identifier is maintained that associate a distinct source of the social networking platform  **404**  to a federated profile.

The profile updating module  **410**  is configured to update or modify the profiles based on further verification of the federated profiles after auto-validation. For example, even after the credentialing by the respondents  **204** , the auto-validation may demand to modify the federated profiles which the profiles updating module  **410**  may do, in some cases after seeking permissions from the experts  **202**. The profile updating module  **410**  may be communicatively coupled to the profile management server  **302**  so as the federated profile manager  **208**  to store and maintain the modified federated and common profiles.

In an embodiment, the social networking platform  **404**  may be defined as a network with an arbitrary large number of networked computers accessing the social network  **404**  through registered social profiles. The social network  **404**  facilitates posting and sharing online profiles, data, clinical reviews simultaneously viewable by each of the arbitrary large number of computers including such as a clinical provider computer, reviewer's computer, third party's computer, respondent's computer, expert's computer, patient's computer, and the like.

The social networking platform  **404**  may include for example one or more social networking sources. The sources may be such as social networking websites, educational institutions, employers' databases or portals or platforms, hiring agencies' portals, and other such sources of creating a socially aware network. Some examples of social networking websites are without limitations Linkedin, MySpace, About Me, etc.

A service provider may deploy the credentialing system  **206**  and provide credentialing services to various organizations or agencies that can be a hiring agency, recruitment and selection or placement department or agency, document or inventions or ideas reviewing and scoring and evaluation agencies, an entity such as a hospital or a medical institute, research organization education institute, transportation company, energy department, financial institution and the like. The organizations such as document or inventions or ideas reviewing and scoring and evaluation organizations can deploy these systems in-house for evaluation of ideas or documents. An expert such as  **202**  a may submit his profile details to the service provider that may be stored in the system  **206**. The service provider may obtain verifications and credentialing of the profile details or other information provided by the expert  **202**  a and may store the information pertinent to the credentialing of the information of the expert  **202**  a . The service provider may utilize a crowdsourced network  **106**  of people including such as the respondent  **204**  a or authorizer  **204**  a who may be any other expert or any of the respondents  **204**. The service provider, expert  **202**  a and the respondent or authorizer  **204**  a may connect with one another over the network  **106**  through a web-based graphical user interface that may serve as a portal for interconnection. The portal or interface may provide a subscription section through which the entities such as the expert  **202**  a , agency, or the respondent/authorizer  **204**  a may associate them with the credentialing system  **206**. Different sections may be provided for each to the expert  **202**  a , respondent  **204**  a , and agency. Upon subscription, the expert  **202**  a may be allowed to submit his details to the system  **206**  and/or create a profile.

The profile information may be publicly visible in some embodiments or may be made visible to the specific respondent  **204**  a by the service provider for credentialing purposes and receiving responses from the respondent  **204**  a about the expert  **202**  a . The profile information may be credentialed and verified in entirety or in segments as discussed above and may be stored in the system  **206**. The agency may thus know accreditation or credentialing about the expert  **202**  a by visiting the portal through a separate section defined for such agencies. Therefore, through the web-based portal or interface, the agency may be facilitated to collect credentialing information and the authenticity about the expert's profiles and other information by visiting the single centralized system  **206**  and may not need to verify the details of the profiles from several sources such as workplaces, educational institutes etc. Further, since the server  **108**  performs credentialing from a crowdsourced network of experts  **202** , therefore, the accuracy of the credentialing and authenticity and reliability of the profiles' information may be higher and the agency can rely on the information with a greater degree of trust and reliability. Further, since the profile information is segmented into the federated profiles, therefore, the credentialing may be more specific to each of the information details contained in the federated profiles and the agency may easily know which information is verified and which is not or which may be pending for verification. In some embodiments, the agency may also know who verified a particular federated profile, when was a particular federated profile verified, and how many unique verifications are done for a specific federated profile. Therefore, with all these features provided through the present system  **206** , the credentialing may be made easier, quicker, trustable, reliable, accurate, and manageable.

FIG. 5, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 4, illustrates a method flowchart for facilitating crowdsourced and multi-level credentialing over the network for use of multi-level credentialed information through the crowdsourced network  **106**. The method may include receiving the profile information from the plurality of crowdsourced experts  **202**  at step  **502**. The information may include demographic, personal, educational, work history related or other types of details. The method may also include collating the information and creating a common profile specific for each of the experts  **202**. In other embodiments, the submission of the information by the experts  **202**  may be performed in an automated and defined way through a web interface such that a profile is automatically created upon submission of the information and/or subscription with the credentialing system  **206**. The method may further include segmenting the common profile associated with each of the plurality of experts  **202**  into a plurality of federated profiles at step  **504** , such that one set of federated profiles is created from a common profile associated with an expert such as  **202**  a . Therefore, two types of profiles: a common profile and federated profiles are maintained by the system  **206**. The method may further include allowing the federated profiles to be made available in public such that the federated profiles may be viewed by the crowdsourced plurality of respondents  **204**  or other experts  **202**. The method may further include receiving responses from the plurality of crowdsourced respondents  **204**  for the federated profiles at step  **506**  over a distributed blockchain configured network. The responses may define credentialing of the federated profiles. For example, the system  **206**  may allow the respondents  **204**  to credential the information contained in the federated profiles. The more times the verifications or credentialing done by the respondents  **204**  uniquely, the more accurate and reliable the credentialing of the federated profiles is.

The responses may define certification or credentialing of information contained in the federated profiles and the common profiles. The credentialing may be associated with each of the federated profiles individually and may conclude in either verified as correct or verified as wrong. Further, the crowdsourced credentialing facilitates the certification of each of the federated profiles by one or more respondents  **204**  so as to cumulate an effect of the certification at multiple levels defined by each respondent. For example, the certification may be done at a first level when a first respondent such as  **204**  a certifies a particular federated profile. The second level certification may be done when another new respondent  **204**  b credentials or verifies the same federated profiles. Similarly, multi-level certification, or credentialing may be performed. The cumulated effect of the certification allows to associate a cumulative segment rating or cumulative federated profile rating to each of the federated profiles associated with each of the experts  **202**. The responses associated with each of the federated profiles are associated with attributes defining the source and the respondent certifying the federated profiles, and a date of certification by the respondent. It must be appreciated that the terms certification, verification, and credentialing are interchangeably used in the document without any limitations. The method may further include associating a rating to the federated and common profiles after credentialing of the profiles by the respondents  **204**. The method and system allows the multi-level credentialing by executing the crowdsourced credentialing process and also by performing credentialing of the federated profiles as well as the common profiles.

In some embodiments, the method may further include auto-validating the response or the credentialing done by the plurality of respondents  **204**  to further certify the information provided by the respondents  **204**  for each of the federated profiles at step  **508**. The auto-validation can be performed through one or more sources of the social networking platform  **404**  that associates an expert such as  **202**  a through a social networking profile of the expert  **202**  a . The method may further include either refining the federated profile rating for each of the federated profiles or associating a separate rating based on a mapping of each of the federated profiles with the social networking profile at step  **510**. The method may further include facilitating an access by the plurality of entities to retrieve the responses identifying credentialing and certification and the refined or associated rating through the web-based portal operating in the crowdsourced network at step  **512**. The agencies may thus retrieve credentialed information from the service provider through the system  **206**  and may not need to individually verify the information about an expert from several sources.

In some embodiments, the method of auto-validating may include automatically searching from a social networking database associated with the social networking sources to verify information about each of the federated profiles. In response to the detection of a mismatch between the searched information and the federated profile, the method may further include suggesting a federated profile update. The method may further include suggesting the social networking profile update to the social networking platform  **404**. In this manner the service provider may find an opportunity to collaborate with the social networking sources and may continually exchange any update on information from one another such that a credentialing process may flow either sides from both the service provider and the social networking sources.

In some embodiments, the respondents may include one or more of profile owners and other experts or other persons.

In some embodiments, the method may include using the plurality of application programming interfaces (APIs)  **406**  to allow verification of information associated with each of the federated profiles of the plurality of experts  **202**  from the social profiles of the professionals or experts  **202**  maintained by the social networking platform  **404**. The APIs  **406**  may be adapted to link each of the federated profiles to one or more distinct sources of the social networking platform  **404**  such that a unique identifier is maintained that associate a distinct source of the social networking platform  **404**  to the respective federated profile.

In accordance with an embodiment herein, the system  **206**  may be configured to perform social crowdsourced credentialing of certified professionals  **202**.

In accordance with an embodiment herein, the professionals or experts  **202**  may be accredited or credentialed by the system  **206**  as required before working in practice locations such a hospitals or other industry location.

In some embodiments, the credentialed expertise of experts may be used for the purposes of evaluation and review and scoring of documents. The document can include without limitations text, media, and other type of digital content or portions and fragments of text, media, or other type of digital content. For example, in an embodiment, the review and scoring and commenting based on the various attributes can be done for an entire document, media, or other types of digital content. In some embodiments, the review and scoring and commenting based on the various attributes can be done for a portion of an entire document, media, or other types of digital content.

In accordance with an embodiment herein, the system  **206**  is configured to create the federated profiles and/or federated credentialing databases that may allow multiple parties such as respondents  **204**  to crowdsource and socially credential the professionals  **202**.

In accordance with an embodiment herein, the system  **206**  may be configured to facilitate disintermediating of credentialing services by for example allowing practices, hospitals, etc. to share each others' credentialing through the social, crowdsourced, blockchain configured distributed architecture. The system  **206**  can allow creation of the profiles by the experts  **202**.

The system  **206**  is configured to provide a capability or a federation model that may facilitate creating of profiles. These profiles can be exchanged and credentialing information may also be exchanged between various agencies or other parties. In an embodiment, the credentialing system  **206**  may allow credentialing to be performed amongst specific agencies so that for example if hospital A (first agency or respondent) trusts hospital B (second agency or respondent), and the first agency credential a first part of the profile of a professional and the second agency credential a second part of the profile, then both these agencies may together create a more accurate profile with the use of the system  **206**  than created independently by sharing the credentialing information known to them individually in the form of responses to the originally created profile. The original profile that is created by the experts  **202**  serves as the common profile. The profile may then be segmented into federated profiles such that each of the agencies may credential at least one of the federated profiles. Upon thus credentialing, the agencies may share the credentialed federated profiles such that an overall and more accurate accreditation of the originally created profile may be performed by the system  **100**. The system  **100**  may also consider the trust factor among the various credentialing parties or agencies or respondents  **204**. For example, in the example above the first agency may identify that the second agency is a trusted source and therefore any profile credentialed by the second agency may be acceptable by the first agency. Therefore, the agencies  **110**  amongst themselves can together collaboratively perform credentialing and accreditation by deploying the system  **100**  internally, in some embodiments, without using a service from a third party service provider.

In an embodiment, the system  **206**  may allow the respondents  **204**  to disagree with one another. For example, a single federated profile may be credentialed by one respondent in one manner while the same profile may be credentialed by another respondent in another manner such that the way of credentialing by the second respondent may or may not be contradicting with the way the first respondent credential the same federated profile. Therefore, in such cases, the system  **206**  may allow to associate a degree of disagreement between the two or more credentialing patterns offered by the two or more respondents  **404**. The associated metrics or degrees or disagreement may be used by an expert such as  **202**  a or any agency to determine a level of trust for a particular credentialing with respect to a particular federated or a common profile of an expert such as  **202**  a . The credentialing responses from both or more of such respondents  **204**  may be viewable in the system  **206**.

In accordance with an embodiment, the system  **206**  may allow a profile owner who may be an expert such as  **202**  a to dispute the way credentialing is performed by the one or more respondents of  **204**  with respect to his federated or common profile. The profile owner who can be any one of the experts  **202**  may offer his remarks through the system  **206**  which can be viewable by others. Based on such remarks by the profile owner, the system  **206**  may update, or modify or delete or retain as such the credentialing inputs from the respondents  **204**.

In some embodiments, the system  **206**  may define desirable standards for code of conduct by the crowdsourced respondents. In cases of breach of the standards by any of the respondents  **204** , the system  **206**  may either invalidate enrollment of the respondents  **204**  with the system  **206**  and/or may delete credentialing information provided by such respondents  **204**  and/or may issue a warning. In cases of subsequent breaches, the system  **206**  may permanently block such respondents  **204**  from credentialing any of the professionals or experts associated with the system  **206**. In an embodiment, the system  **206**  may therefore be configured to facilitate crowdsourced credentialing in association with the set standards of credentialing. The certification engine  **212**  may allow the plurality of respondents  **204**  to respond to the federated profiles associated with the professionals  **202**  and credential them only when the set standards of conduct are met. In cases of breach of the standards, the certification engine  **212**  may record details for the respondents  **204**  and use it as an input in future processing of the credentialing by the same respondents  **204**.

In some embodiments, the system  **206**  may further facilitate tracking of the experts' code of conduct or their ethical breaches etc. For example, the system  **206**  may be configured to associate the profiles of the experts  **202**  with information pertinent to the code of conduct, ethical lapses, past ethical behavior, recently known ethical lapses and other such information about the experts  **202**. The information may be collected from various sources or may be reported by any other relevant or reliable expert or person or any member of the crowdsourced network  **106**  or any member subscribed with the system  **206**  and the like. Such ethical lapses may be updated in the fragmented and common profiles of the experts  **202**. In some embodiments, the already credentialed profiles may also be changed or updated based on such ethical information. For example, credentialing information of a doctor as an expert who is credentialed through the system  **206**  by one or more respondents  **204**  may be invalidated upon finding of ethical lapses. In such cases, the profile may be directly updated so as to state the new ethical lapses in the profile or the profile may be considered as not credentialed at all, thus withdrawing prior credentials or the profile may be modified in any other manner so as to explicitly report the new lapses in the profile and update it accordingly.

FIG. 6, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 5, illustrates an expert scoring module  **112**  in accordance with an embodiment herein. The expert scoring module  **112**  determines a set of attributes for the experts  **202**. In an embodiment, the expert scoring module  **112**  may be coupled to or may include the expert attributes engine  **110**  for determining the set of attributes for the experts  **202**. The set of attributes of the experts  **202**  may include the crowdsourced credentialed expertise determined by the credentialing system or engine  **206**  based on the credentialing of the federated and common profiles of the experts  **202**  by the respondents  **204**  as discussed above in conjunction with various figures. An extent of the credentialed expertise of the experts  **202**  by a plurality of crowdsourced respondents  **204**  determines an extent of credentialed expertise and capability of the experts  **202**  for review of defined documents for which the credentialed expertise is sought as an attribute. The credentialed expertise defines a non-linear and dynamic parameter of scoring the experts  **202**  for review of the documents based on the crowdsourcing, in some embodiments.

In an embodiment, the set of attributes for an expert such as  **202**  a may include the reputation of the expert  **202**  a indicative of a trust of a relevant community on the expert  **202**  a . The scoring module  **112**  may include or be coupled to a reputation assessment engine  **602**  that determines reputation of the experts  **202**  that indicate trust of relevant communities on the experts  **202**. In an example, reputation can be assessed based on experts' interaction with others on expert networking sites, information exchange platforms, and other knowledge interaction platforms. For example, an expert  **202**  a may interact with a community including other experts in a relevant field for example medical equipment design through a knowledge platform. The interaction may be of the type of posting questions relevant to the field of medical equipment design, submitting answers to such questions posted by others, reviewing answers posted by others in response to such questions. Any such interaction may lead to building or losing of reputation of an expert  **202**  a who interacts. The ways of building or losing of the reputation, together referred to as reputation assessment may be defined by the reputation assessment engine  **602**. The reputation assessment engine  **602**  may for example evaluate and assess reputation of an expert  **202**  a based on quality of the questions posted by him, quality of the answers posted by him in response to questions posted by others, or quality of review performed by the expert  **202**  a for answers submitted by others. The reputation in such cases may be assessed by calculating number of positive votes from others in the community, number of negative votes in the community, neutral votes in the community to any kind of interactions by the expert  **202**  a . In an embodiment, any positive vote (for example a like comment or remark or vote) for a question posted by the expert  **202**  a may earn him 10 points of reputation, and any negative vote (such as any dislike remark, comment or vote) may cause the expert to lose 10 points from the reputation. In an embodiment, any positive vote on an answer posted by the expert may earn him 20 points and any negative vote on such an answer may cause him to lose 20 points. In an embodiment, any positive vote on a review of an answer by the expert may earn him 25 points and any negative vote by others in the community on such a review may cause him to lose 25 points. In other embodiments, various other ways of assessment of the reputation may be defined without limitations. In an example, the reputation of an expert  **202**  a may be tied to a relevant field or a relevant community by the reputation assessment engine. For example, the reputation assessment engine  **602**  may allocate a reputation of 50 in the area or community of medical equipments design but the same expert  **202**  a may be allocated a reputation of −20 in the field or community of medical devices programming. The reputation may be defined as positive value points as well as negative value points—the positive points defining a degree of increasing trust by the community, and the negative points defining a decreasing trust by the community.

In an example, the extent of trust may be identified through voting. For example, votes can be posted in integral or fractional numbers such as +3, +3.5, −2, −4.2, and the like. In this way, a net summation of all the votings weighted with reputation assessment parameters (such as mentioned above) that define how much reputation points are earned or lost with each interaction, may result in the reputation of an expert  **202**  a for a particular field or community.

Once the reputation assessment engine  **602**  evaluates reputation of an expert  **202**  a for a particular field or community (which is same as or similar to the field of the document under review), the document scoring module  **112**  may use the reputation of the expert  **202**  a for determining score of the document by using the reputation as an expert attribute. In such cases, experts  **202**  and reputations of experts  **202**  that are from the same or similar fields or communities as that of the documents under review are considered only so as to establish trust and authority of the experts  **202**  by the relevant communities and use it as an indicator for validity and authenticity of documents review and scoring after aggregation of reputations from various such experts  **202**.

In some embodiments, the reputation assessment engine  **602**  may also be capable of aggregating various discrete reputations from individual crowdsourced experts  **202**  connected over a blockchain configured network so as to determine an aggregate reputation for a group of crowdsourced experts  **202**  used in evaluation, reviewing and scoring of a document. The aggregate score may be a net equivalent score that can be associated with the crowdsourced experts  **202**  to indicate the reputation of the entire crowdsourced community of the experts  **202**  contributing toward document review and scoring.

In an embodiment, the reputation can be determined by querying internal corporate databases, when users are internal, and from the number of past performance records based on previous projects.

The set of attributes may include an officiality indicative of a position or a designation of an expert  **202**  a in a relevant job. The scoring module  **112**  may include or be coupled to an officiality engine  **604**  that determines officiality of the experts  **202**. In an example, different hierarchical positions as an indicator of officiality may be associated with specific ratings that may be used to associate an officiality score to an expert  **202**  a . The officiality engine  **604**  may determine such officiality scores for individual crowdsourced experts  **202**. In some embodiments, the officiality engine  **604**  may also be capable of determining an aggregate officiality score for a crowdsourced community of the experts  **202**  that contribute to review and scoring of the document. The aggregate score may be a net equivalent score that can be associated with the crowdsourced experts  **202**  as a group to indicate the officiality of the entire crowdsourced community of experts  **202**  contributing toward document review and scoring. In the context of the embodiments herein, officiality refers to a qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation assessment of the crowdsourced community of experts  **202**. This legitimizes the score provided by the experts  **202**.

In an embodiment, the attributes are assigned varying weights by a weight module  **606**. The information about assigned weights of the attributes for the experts relevant for a particular document review and scoring may be stored in the memory circuit  **118**  and retrieved by the weight module  **606**  as and when the document is reviewed and scored by the scoring module  **112**  and the experts  **202**  are needed for the review and scoring. In an example, the weight module  **606**  identifies a degree of relevance and significance of an expert attribute with the electronic document to be reviewed and accordingly assign a weight to each of the attributes of the experts based on the identified degree of significance. In an example, the credentialed expertise is weighed as the highest by the weight module  **606**  followed by the officiality, and the attribute of reputation is weighed as the lowest by the weight module among the three exemplary attributes.

In addition to expertise, officiality, and reputation, other attributes may include without limitations such as geographical presence that is indicative of spatial relationships such as to indicate if a person has lived in a particular area for a while for a defined time, spousal or family or close relationships with other experts, and the like. For example, knowing an expert and having a good relationship with him may be an attribute.

In an example, the weight module  **606**  is adapted to dynamically change weights and weight assignment based on the type of the document to be reviewed. This could be based on document type and content of the document. For example, the weight assignment may be based on complexity of technology of the document content. The weight module  **606**  may define content parameters that may influence weight assignment process and accordingly dynamically associate weights to the attributes for considering experts  **202**  for the document scoring and reviewing process. In an example, the weight module  **606**  can dynamically associate weights for not only review of the entire document but also intra-document federated sections also. For example, a first set of weights may be defined and associated to various experts' attributes for review of a first section of a document and a second set of weights different from the first set of weights may be defined and associated to a second section of the document. For example, in the first set of weights, the credentialed expertise may be weighted highest while the reputation may be weighed highest in the second set of weights.

In some embodiments, the expert scoring module  **112**  determines an aggregate score of an expert  **202**  a based on the one or more attributes including credentialed expertise, officiality, and reputation, in association with the assigned weights for the attributes. The expert score defines a rating for the expert that is indicative of expert suitability for review and scoring of a particular document for which the expert  **202**  a is sought.

FIG. 7, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 6, illustrates a document scoring module  **114**  in accordance with an exemplary embodiment herein. The document scoring module  **114**  receives review comments along with a document rating by each of the crowdsourced experts  **202**  for an electronic document. In an example, a facility of the document reviewing and scoring may be provided only to those experts  **202**  who possess a defined threshold of the aggregate score as minimum criteria. The document scoring module  **114**  associates an aggregate score to the electronic document based on aggregation of the review ratings by the crowdsourced experts  **202**  and the aggregate scores of each of the crowdsourced experts based  **202**  on the set of attributes including one or more of the credentialed expertise, reputation of the expert, and the officiality. In an embodiment, the document scores by a plurality of crowdsourced experts  **202**  may be performed based on an affect of crowdsourcing index that may bear a non-linear relationship with the crowdsourcing score. The crowdsourcing index may be associated with the credentialing process or credentialed expertise and may be indicative of a degree of crowdsourcing such that the degree of crowdsourcing non-linearly affects the degree of credentialing that is indicative through the crowdsourcing index. In some embodiments, the crowdsourcing index may be defined in a manner similar to the crowdsourcing index defined for the experts credentialing, as discussed above.

Therefore, the embodiments herein provide a multi-level crowdsourcing-based and calculated document score derived through the use of a non-linearly relational parameter defining a non-linear relationship of the multi-level crowdsourcing on the experts score and the documents score in the respective discrete levels of the multi-level crowdsourcing. In an embodiment, the multi-level crowdsourcing may include two levels of crowdsourcing wherein the first level includes credentialing of an expert  **202**  a by a plurality of crowdsourced respondents  **202**  and the second level includes scoring of an electronic document by the crowdsourced credentialed experts  **202**  that show at least a minimum threshold aggregate expert score derived from the first level of crowdsourcing.

In some embodiments, the document scoring module  **114**  includes a document aggregate score assessment engine  **702** , comment analysis module  **704** , comment aggregator  **706** , semantics and analytics engine  **708** , and document classification/tagging module  **710**.

In some embodiments, the document aggregate score assessment engine  **702**  determines an aggregate score of the document based on individual scores of the document from individual crowdsourced experts  **202**. The document aggregate score assessment engine  **702**  may also utilize a non-linear crowdsourcing index for determining the aggregate score. The comment analysis module  **704**  may analyze review comments posted by the experts  **202**  while reviewing the documents. The comments serve as a learning and knowledge repository in evaluating the document in detail. The aggregate score of the document may thus be associated with a subjective comment section for use by second level reviewers etc. The comment analysis module  **704**  may be coupled to or may include the comment aggregator  **706**. The comment aggregator  **706**  may collate comments from various individual experts  **202**. For example, the comment aggregator  **706**  may collate similar types of comments together. The comment aggregator  **706**  and comment analysis module  **704**  may be coupled to the semantics and analytics engine  **708**  that facilitates comments classification, collation, and analysis by implementing various semantics, analytics, and learning algorithms, functions, tools, programs and the like. The semantics engine  **708**  infers logical consequences from the review comments. The semantics engine  **708**  utilizes semantics and machine learning tools to determine intent and contextual meaning of terms as they appear in content of the review comments to generate more relevant results. The document classification/tagging module  **710**  may determine a relevant category or taxonomy class and accordingly tag the document for the classified category. The category may be decided based on for example defined classes, based on technology areas and sub areas, based on reviews, based on value of content and the like.

The comment aggregator  **706** , comment analysis module  **704** , and the semantics analytics engine  **708**  together may be referred to as Natural Language Processing-based analysis engine (NLP-based analysis engine)  **712**. The NLP-based analysis engine  **712**  may be configured to process textual information-based reviews and comments generated as part of textual review of the electronic documents by the experts  **202**.

The document scoring module  **114**  further includes a visual scoring engine  **714**  for processing visual and non-language or non-textual feedback and reviews by the experts  **202**  during review of the electronic documents. In an example, various components of the visual scoring engine  **714**  are illustrated in FIG. 8. The visual scoring engine  **714**  and visual reviews by the experts  **202**  are discussed herein with reference to various figures and in particular to FIGS. 7 and 8.

The visual scoring engine  **714**  may include an eye tracks processor  **802** , a micro expressions processor  **804** , an image processor  **806** , and neural networks  **808**. The eye tracks processor  **802**  may receive inputs from an eye movements tracking device or an eye tracking system  **810**  which may be associated with a computing device of an expert such as  **202**  a so that when the expert  **202**  a reviews a document, the computing device may capture eye movements during an entire review process and transmit the information to the server  **108**  which hosts the eye tracks processor within the visual scoring engine  **714**. The eye tracking system  **810**  may be configured to accurately measure fast eye movements and may be controlled by a microprocessor and software to rapidly track the expert's eye movements. The eye tracking system  **810**  may include a camera also. The hardware for the eye tracking system  **810**  may include a quadrant detector which may detect the relative direction of movement of the expert's eyes. The output of the quadrant detector may be processed by the microprocessor under the control of software subsystems. The eye tracking system  **810**  may record an entire review session and eye movements involved in the review session so that a digital file containing the recorded session indicative of eye movements and eye tracks may be transmitted to the eye tracks processor  **802**  for processing and subsequent scoring of visual reviews by the visual scoring engine  **714**. The eye tracks processor  **802**  of the visual scoring engine  **714**  may process the data received from the eye tracking system  **810**  with the use of special purpose processing circuitry and software subsystems which enable interpretation of the data signifying eye tracks and movements. The eye tracks processor  **802**  may convert the data into high level interpretations indicative of time lapse on specific sections of the document under review, repeat reading, coherence between eye focus and scrolling speed, blinks, expert's gaze location, eye fixations, saccades, gaze rate, gaze direction, gaze percentage, number of fixations, scan path directionality, instances of backtracking, frequency of long duration dwells over areas of interest, saccade length, fixation/saccade time ratio, visual profile of review-flow and the like. These interpretations may be compared with predefined and pre-stored eye patterns or vocabularies. The predefined eye patterns and vocabularies may also signify particular interpretations and associated scores so that upon comparison of the interpretations gathered by analyzing the data by the eye tracks processor  **802**  and the predefined patterns and respective interpretations, the eye tracks processor  **802**  may associate a review score for the eye tracks which may indicate quality of review based on eye movements. The eye tracks processor  **802**  may process the recorded eye tracking data and convert it into high level interpretations to reveal information about eye behaviors and basic mental states of the expert such as expert  **202**  _a._

The eye tracking information may be used to determine points of interest in an image or a text of the document under review. For example, a content provider may present an image or text for review so that the eye tracking information may then be used to determine which sections of the image or text information tend to draw the expert's attention and accordingly associate a visual score using predefined interpretations and eye tracks patterns which may be indicative of visual feedback and review and quality of the reviewed content accordingly.

The visual scoring engine  **714**  may further include the micro expressions processor  **804**  which may receive data indicative of micro expressions from a micro expressions sensor  **812**  which may be associated with a computing device of an expert such as  **202**  a so that when the expert  **202**  a reviews a document, the micro expressions sensor  **812**  may capture micro expressions or facial expressions during an entire review process and transmit the information to the visual scoring engine  **714**  which hosts the micro expressions processor  **804**. The micro expressions processor  **804**  may work along with the image processor  **806**  to interpret micro expressions and facial expressions received from the micro expressions sensor  **812**. In an example, the image processor  **806**  may contain the micro expressions processor  **804**. In an example, the image processor  **806**  and the micro expressions processor  **804**  may be discrete components that are connected communicatively and operatively.

The micro expressions sensor  **812**  may be associated with the computing device of the expert  **202**  a . The micro expressions sensor  **812**  may be configured to sense human expressions and gestures and convey this sensed information to the micro expressions processor  **804**. In an example, the micro expressions sensor  **812**  may be configured within a camera or an optical sensor. The micro expressions sensor  **812**  may be configured for image (or video) acquisition, face detection, and recognition.

The image processor  **806**  may contain image processing circuitry and an associated memory. The image processor  **806**  may receive the data from the micro expressions sensor  **812**  and perform pre-processing and processing tasks such as normalizing the data and extracting certain facial images using various imaging filters. The image pre-processing and processing tasks may involve cropping, re-sizing, lighting, coloring, masking to extract certain facial features, eliminating unwanted features such as hair, background, extraneous features in the facial data sensed by the facial expressions sensor  **812**  which provide no information about facial expressions. The image processor  **806**  generates an output to be used by the micro expressions processor  **804**  to recognize and interpret micro expressions during the review process by the expert  **202**  a using such as mathematical algorithms without limitations. These interpretations of the micro expressions may be indicative of human facial characteristics, moods, emotions, gestures etc. The facial characteristics, moods, emotions, gestures etc. together referred as micro expressions are read through micro movements of bodies of the experts  **202**  by the facial expressions sensor  **812**. This is used as an input by the micro expression processor  **804**  and interpreted using complex algorithms either using statistical approaches or artificial intelligence and neural networks  **808**. The micro expressions processor  **804**  may be configured to locate human face and associated physical/facial characteristics of an individual. In an embodiment, the micro expressions processor  **804**  may detect faces in a plurality of video frames as input and extract dynamic facial expressions and movements into an output file.

The interpreted facial expressions may reveal information about the review by the experts  **202**. The micro expressions processor  **804**  may store predefined expressions patterns within a memory circuit which may be used to correlate the sensed and processed micro expressions and facial inputs to determine expert's review thoughts in the form of a visual feedback. These micro expressions may even allow interpreting review thoughts that might otherwise remain involuntarily hidden and suppressed in a textual review or text-based comments.

The interpreted micro facial expressions may be compared with the predefined facial expression patterns or vocabularies stored in the memory circuit associated with the visual scoring engine such as the memory circuit  **118**. The predefined patterns and vocabularies may signify particular interpretations and associated scores so that upon comparison of the interpretations gathered by analyzing the data by the micro expressions processor  **806**  and the predefined patterns and respective interpretations, the micro expressions processor  **804**  may associate a review score for the micro expressions which may indicate quality of review based on facial expressions. Thus, the visual scoring engine  **714**  may associate another score based on micro expressions.

The review score associated by the eye tracks processor  **802**  and the review score associated by the micro expressions processor  **804**  may together constitute visual scores determined by the visual scoring engine as part of entire review of electronic documents by the experts.

The document aggregate score assessment engine  **702**  may collate the review scores obtained from the NLP-based analysis engine  **712**  based on textual scoring, visual scores obtained from the eye tracks processor  **802**  and the micro expressions processor  **804** , in accordance with various algorithmic, mathematical, empirical, statistical and other types of tools as discussed elsewhere in the document in accordance with various embodiments.

In an example, various empirical relations such as mentioned below without limitations may be used to determine the aggregate document score based on individual attributes of the crowdsourced experts  **202** , scores of the crowdsourced experts  **202** , document scores by individual experts  **202** , aggregation of the experts scores, aggregation of the attributes scores, aggregation of the document's individual scores (textual as well as visual scores), multi-level crowdsourcing index, and aggregation of multiple multi-level crowdsourcing indices.

In accordance with some embodiments as discussed above, the aggregate score of an expert (AES) for one or more attributes may be determined based on an empirical relation. An exemplary empirical relation may be as follows:
 AES=_EW_1+_RW_2+_OW_3
 Above, 'E' represents credentialed expertise, 'R' represents reputation, and 'O' represents officiality, and W1, W2, W3 represent weightage of the credentialed expertise, reputation, and officiality respectively. In other embodiments, other similar empirical or non-empirical relationships with modifications may be considered without limitations.

In accordance with some embodiments as discussed above, the credentialing engine may evaluate the credentialed expertise (E) for the expert based on an empirical relation. In an example, the empirical relation can be as follows:
_E_=(_P_ F11 _+P_ F12 _+ . . . +P_ F1N)×(_P_ F21 _+P_ F22 _+ . . . P_ F2N)_X . . . X_(_P_ FZ1 _+P_ FZ2 _+ . . . +P_ FZN)
 Above,
 PF11 represents credentialed federated profile score for a first federated profile of a first expert by a first respondent,
 PF12 represents credentialed federated profile score for the first federated profile of the first expert by a second respondent,
 PF1N represents credentialed federated profile score for the first federated profile of the first expert by an Nth respondent,
 PF21 represents credentialed federated profile score for a second federated profile of the first expert by the first respondent,
 PF22 represents credentialed federated profile score for the second federated profile of the first expert by the second respondent,
 PF2N represents credentialed federated profile score for the second federated profile of the first expert by the Nth respondent,
 PFZ1 represents credentialed federated profile score for a Zth federated profile of the first expert by the first respondent,
 PFZ2 represents credentialed federated profile score for the Zth federated profile of the first expert by the second respondent, and
 PFZN represents credentialed federated profile score for the Zth federated profile of the first expert by the Nth respondent.

In an example, the empirical relation above considers profiles scores for entire federated profiles from 1 to Z. In an example, the empirical relation above considers all respondents  **204**  from 1 to N. In accordance with other embodiments, other similar empirical or non-empirical relationships with modifications may be considered without limitations.

In accordance with some embodiments as discussed above, the document reviewing and scoring engine  **114**  evaluates aggregate crowdsourced document score (ACDS) based on credentialed expertise and other attributes of the crowdsourced experts, based on an empirical relation. An exemplary relation can be as follows:
 ACDS={(_E_ 1 _+E_ 2 _+E_ 3 _+ . . . +E_ X)_W_ 1+(_R_ 1 _+R_ 2 _+R_ 3 _+ . . . +R_ X)_W_ 2+(_O_ 1 _+O_ 2 _+O_ 3 _+ . . . +O_ X)_W_ 3}(_D_ 1 _+D_ 2 _+D_ 3 _+ . . . +D_ X)CI
 E1, E2, E3, . . . EX represent respective credentialed expertise of X number of crowdsourced experts,
 R1, R2, R3, . . . RX represent respective reputation of the X number of crowdsourced experts,
 O1, O2, O3, . . . OX represent respective officiality of the X number of crowdsourced experts,
 D1, D2, D3 . . . DX represent respective document scores earned by the X number of crowdsourced experts, and
 CI represents Non-Linear Crowdsourcing Index.
 In other embodiments, other similar empirical or non-empirical relationships with modifications may be considered without limitations.

In some embodiments, the CI is defined non-linearly with integral ranges (R) of experts who credential the document. In an example, first five of the ranges can be as follows without limitations:

CI=1, when R=0-2 experts,

CI=1.2, when R=3-4 experts,

CI=1.5, when R=5-6 experts

CI=1.9, when R=7-8 experts, and

CI=2.5, when R=9-10 experts.

In an example, the CI may be calculated based on an empirical relationship that dynamically determines value of the CI with every integral change in number of expert credentialing the document.

In some embodiments, the document can include without limitations text, media, and other type of digital content or portions and fragments of text, media, or other type of digital content. For example, in an embodiment, the review and scoring and commenting based on the various attributes can be done for an entire document, media, or other types of digital content. In some embodiments, the review and scoring and commenting based on the various attributes can be done for portions of an entire document, media, or other types of digital content. In an embodiment, the document scoring module  **114**  can distribute (hand out) documents, document fragments, media, content or content fragments to the experts  **202**  based on the content of the documents and the experts' attributes. That means that the scoring module  **114**  can understand who knows what and based on the content of documents it can distribute all or portions of the document to various experts  **202**.

In accordance with some embodiments herein, the system, and various modules and engines in the system discussed above may facilitate interaction among various experts and entities within an organization, and across and outside an organization as well, without limitations.

In accordance with various embodiments, the electronic document review and scoring system may be configured to validate identities of the experts  **202**  for review of the documents to ensure that the documents are reviewed by the experts  **202**  who are assigned the documents for review and not by fraudulent parties or by someone else on behalf of the experts  **202**. The electronic document review and scoring system  **102**  therefore may include or be operatively coupled to a blockchain configured expert identity validation appliance  **902**  as shown in FIG. 9. The blockchain configured expert identity validation appliance  **902**  may include a device patterns assessment device  **904** , a network patterns assessment device  **906** , a geo-spatial mapping device  **908** , and a facial expression-based validation device  **910**.

The blockchain configured expert identity validation appliance  **902**  may use inputs and vocabularies from the memory circuit such as the memory circuit  **118**  to identify rules and accordingly execute advanced blockchain validation mechanisms to verify identities of the experts  **202**  who review the documents through the distributed blockchain configured electronic document review and scoring system  **102**.

The blockchain configured expert identity validation appliance  **902**  may include a non-volatile computer-readable memory and a processor which may be configured to receive a private key from experts  **202**. The experts  **202**  may be authorized to review the documents privately using the private key. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize there can be a variety of different proof standards that could be used by the blockchain configured expert identity validation appliance  **902**. The proof standard may be based on proof of work, such as hash value requirements, proof of stake, such as a key or other indicator of consensus, or any other kind or proof of consensus. The proof standard may be applied as a rule that may require a hash value to be less than the proof standard, more than the proof standard, or have a required bit sequence or a required number of leading or trailing zeroes. Any proof standard may be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the embodiments herein.

The blockchain configured expert identity validation appliance  **902**  may be configured to validate identity of an expert such as  **202**  a accessing the documents for review to establish a trusted information review and interaction. The blockchain configured expert identity validation appliance  **902**  may utilize a variety of identity validation algorithms and schemes such as but not limited to facial expressions, geographical coordinates, geo-tags, gestures, muscle activity, and the like. In accordance with a specific type of validation scheme utilized by the blockchain configured expert identity validation appliance  **902** , a validation scheme-based device may be utilized. Few embodiments, in particular, are discussed herein in conjunction with FIG. 9 that provide for the use of geo-spatial mapping, facial expression, network patterns assessment, device patterns assessment for validation of identities of the experts  **202**  performing review of the documents.

In an embodiment, the blockchain configured expert identity validation appliance  **902**  may obtain geographical coordinates associated with an expert  **202**  a from a global position system (GPS)-based device  **912**  associated with the expert  **202**  a . The blockchain configured expert identity validation appliance  **902**  may tag the documents reviewed by the expert  **202**  a using geo-tags to establish a geographical identity with the documents reviewed by the expert  **202**  a . The geo-tags may be used to validate identity of the expert  **202**  a . For example, the expert  **202**  a may reside in a particular state of the United States as noted from the expert's demographic information stored in the memory circuit  **118**. However, if the GPS-based device  **912**  sends geographical coordinates that indicate another location remote from the United States, the blockchain configured expert identity validation appliance  **902**  may establish a conflict and may not verify such a review provided by such an expert  **202**  a coming from a conflicting geography. If the expert  **202**  a is able to satisfy validation and authorization requirements, the review may then be accepted or else may remain suspended until the requirements are met. The geo-spatial mapping device  **908**  may perform geo-tagging of the experts  **202**  and the reviewed documents and also compare the geo-tags with pre-stored information about the experts  **202**  for processing validation.

In an embodiment, the blockchain configured expert identity validation appliance  **902**  may extract information pertaining to facial expressions of an expert such as the expert  **202**  a from an associated facial expression sensor  **914**. The facial expression sensor  **914**  may be of a variety of types to identify and sense a variety of facial expressions. The sensed facial expressions may be communicated to the blockchain configured expert identity validation appliance  **902**  which may be used by the facial expression-based validation device  **910**  of the blockchain configured expert identity validation appliance  **902**  to perform processing of the sensed facial expressions and verify the identity in accordance with predefined facial patterns of the expert  **202**  a stored in the memory circuit  **118**.

The facial expression sensor (also referred to as face recognition sensor interchangeably)  **914**  may perform automatic face recognition for surveillance, security, authentication or verification purposes of the experts  **202**. Information detected by the facial expression sensor  **914**  may not only expose sensation or passion of experts  **202**  but can also be used to judge their mental views and psychosomatic aspects. The facial expression sensor  **914**  may employ one or more of different techniques such as motion-based approach, muscle-based approach or any other approach without limitations. These approaches may such as involve analysis of aspects originating from bones, tissues, skin, muscles, deformities, contractions, expansions, and so on. The facial expression sensor  **914**  may sense the information and transmit the sensed information to the facial expression-based validation device  **910**  of the blockchain configured expert identity validation appliance  **902**  so that the blockchain configured expert identity validation appliance  **902**  may identify and verify the experts  **202**  interacting with the blockchain configured electronic document review and scoring system  **102**  based on pre-defined parameters signifying complex facial expressions for genuineness and fraud. These pre-defined parameters and related details may be stored in the memory circuit  **118**  associated with the blockchain configured expert identity validation appliance  **902**.

The network patterns assessment device  **906**  may process network information, metadata information, and other network queries and compare with pre-stored fake network patterns and individual network patterns of the experts  **202**  based on historical data and usage preferences, and generate an output indicative of how reliable an expert review is and whether the expert identity is verified and whether the authorized expert himself performed the review or anyone else reviewed the documents on his behalf, based on its network information.

The network information, metadata information, and other network queries may be extracted by an agent device  **916**  associated with a computing device and transmitted to the network patterns assessment device  **906**  for further processing and verification of identity. In an embodiment, the agent device  **916**  may watch browser and network behavior and aggregated behavioral and network information can be submitted to the blockchain configured expert identity verification appliance  **902**  as and when a review is submitted. The behavioral information may be used by the blockchain configured expert identity verification appliance  **902**  to validate whether the behavior exhibited by the expert during review of the documents is in accordance with a preferred and routine behavior of the expert as pre-stored in the memory circuit  **118**. In an example, the agent device  **916**  may extract the network information and periodically (or as and when a review is made) update the blockchain configured expert identity verification appliance  **902**  about the network information. The blockchain configured expert identity verification appliance  **902**  may for example validate whether the network connections are permissible for the particular expert that submits the review or is coming from a suspicious network.

In an example, the agent device  **916**  may extract device information and transmit the device information to the device patterns assessment device  **904**. The device information may include information such as model, serial number, and other information of the computing system associated with the expert  **202**  a . The device patterns assessment device  **904**  may compare the device information received from the agent device  **916**  with pres-stored device information about the expert  **202**  a and associated computing system based on historical data or usage preferences or based on pre-defined submitted device information by the expert  **202**  _a._

The blockchain configured expert identity verification appliance  **902**  may include a digital acquisition unit  **918**  to receive and process signals containing the sensed contextual information from the GPS-based device  **912** , facial expression sensor  **914** , and agent device  **916**. The digital acquisition unit  **918**  may be configured to perform real-time assessments of the sensed received contextual information. The digital acquisition unit  **918**  may include a plurality of multichannel amplifiers  **920**. Each amplifier of the multichannel amplifiers  **920**  may be defined to receive a specific type of sensed information from a particular type of sensor and device. The amplified signals obtained from the plurality of multichannel amplifiers  **920**  are then transmitted to respective processors such as the device patterns assessment device  **904** , network patterns assessment device  **906** , geo-spatial mapping device  **908** , and facial expression-based validation device  **910**. The digital processing unit  **918**  is implemented using an integrated circuit.

FIG. 10, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 9, illustrates a section of a blockchain configured ecosystem  **1100**  for enabling electronic documents review and scoring by the experts  **202**  in accordance with an embodiment. At least some embodiments for enabling various reviews and scoring transactions are discussed herein.

The blockchain configured electronic document review and scoring system  **102**  may provide a private view to the experts  **202**  referred to as private data store  **1002**  so that each expert can privately access certain documents allocated to them for review based on various policies such as based on their respective aggregated scores. Each of the experts  **202**  may access the documents through the dedicated private store  **1002**  available through the plurality of distributed blockchain configured access points  **1004**  which may be enabled in the form of distributed blocks as shown in FIG. 10, with each block providing a facility to access the blockchain configured electronic document review and scoring system  **102**  by multiple experts  **202**  and respondents  **204**  at the same time based on defined and granted access rights.

The private data store  **1002**  may provide a virtual storage to facilitate interaction, information exchange, reviewing, and presentation of documents for review according to granted access for an expert  **202**  a . For example, the private data store  **1002**  may allow a virtual storage and presentation of only limited documents or portions of the documents for access by particular experts  **202**  in accordance with permissions granted to the experts  **202**  for reviewing. The private data store  **1002**  may be configured to auto-hash review interactions at any required interval. This compartmentalization of the documents ensures that the documents are secured and private as per access rights authorized to the experts  **202**. The data presented on the private data store  **1002**  of the blockchain serves as a secure way to ensure that the private data store  **1002**  is in sync with any permissioned access.

In accordance with an exemplary use case of the current embodiment, an expert  **202**  a may enter his/her review comments and feedback into the blockchain configured electronic documents review and scoring system  **102**  by accessing the blockchain configured electronic document review and scoring system  **102**  or the feedback and review comments may be extracted from associated devices, sensors, scanners, and networks, and moved into the electronic document review and scoring system  **102**  through the plurality of distributed access points  **1004**.

In an embodiment, the blockchain configured digital ecosystem  **1100**  may provide a federated blockchain consisting of several entities/participants and associated computers and devices and sensors that jointly create the reviews and attempts to process transfers of data through a trusted, secured and distributed network of the blockchain configured access points  **1004**. Federations can be organized by systems of care such as identified by geography, e.g. community or state. The experts  **1002**  may be assumed to stay within these systems of care that cross organizations. In an example, the federated blockchain may be applied on top of an existing health information exchange community as a way to further reduce costs and help the community reach financial sustainability.

In accordance with an embodiment, the experts  **202**  can access the documents for review based on authorization and access rights granted which may dynamically be updated in accordance with embodiments as discussed elsewhere in the document and in accordance with growing scores such as credentialed score, officiality, etc. The blockchain configured expert identity validation appliance  **902**  may be configured to validate the identity of the experts  **202**  accessing the documents and performing reviews to establish a trusted information review process. The blockchain configured expert identity validation appliance  **902**  may utilize a variety of identity validation algorithms and schemes such as but not limited to facial expressions, geographical coordinates, geo-tags, gestures, muscle activity, and the like. In accordance with a specific type of validation scheme utilized by the blockchain validation device, a validation scheme-based device may be utilized as discussed above.

FIG. 11, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 10, illustrates another view of a portion of the digital ecosystem  **1100**  illustrating multiple experts  **202**  a ,  **202**  b ,  **202**  c ,  **202**  d (together  **202** ); respective associated computing systems  **1102**  a ,  **1102**  b ,  **1102**  c , and  **1102**  d ; respective associated GPS-based devices  **912**  a ,  **912**  b ,  **912**  c , and  **912**  d ; respective associated facial expression sensors  **914**  a ,  **914**  b ,  **914**  c , and  **914**  d ; respective associated cameras or optical sensors  **810**  a ,  **810**  b ,  **810**  c , and  **810**  d ; respective associated facial expression sensors and face recognition devices  **912**  a ,  **912**  b ,  **912**  c , and  **912**  d communicating with the system  **102**  through plurality of distributed blockchain configured access points  **1004**  for electronic documents reviewing as discussed in accordance with various embodiments.

FIG. 12, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 11, illustrates a method flow diagram for performing an expertise driven review and scoring of electronic documents in a crowdsourced environment. The method includes receiving a document from a submitting party for reviewing and scoring by a plurality of crowdsourced experts  **202** , at step  **1202**. The method may further include determining a set of expert attributes including one or more of crowdsourced credentialing, officiality, and reputation, and the like, at step  **1204**. The reputation is indicative of a trust of a relevant community on the expert, and the officiality is indicative of a position or a designation of the expert in a relevant job and the credentialed expertise is indicative of degree of credentialing of an expert's federated and common profiles by crowdsourced respondents. The methods of determining reputation, officiality, and credentialed expertise have been discussed above. The method may further include determining an aggregate score of an expert such as  **202**  a based on the one or more attributes at step  **1206**. The procedure of determining the aggregate score has been discussed above in conjunction with various figures. The method may further include receiving review comments along with a document rating by each of the crowdsourced experts  **202**  at step  **1208**. The method may further include associating an aggregate score to the electronic document based on an aggregation of the review ratings by the crowdsourced experts  **202**  and the aggregate scores of each of the crowdsourced experts  **202**  based on the set of attributes including one or more of the credentialed expertise, reputation of the expert, and the officiality, at step  **1210**. In an example, the method may further include federating a common profile of an expert  **202**  a into a plurality of federated profiles based on commonalities or distinctiveness in content of the federated profiles. The federated profiles are treated as distinct profiles for the purpose of credentialing separately by the crowdsourced respondents  **204**. In an example, the method may also include identifying a degree of relevance and significance of an expert attribute with the electronic document to be reviewed and accordingly assign a weight to each of the attributes of the experts  **202**  based on the identified degree of significance. The method may include associating a crowdsourcing index with the credentialing. The crowdsourcing index is indicative of a degree of crowdsourcing such that the degree of crowdsourcing non-linearly affects the degree of credentialing or the credentialed expertise as discussed above in conjunction with various figures.

The embodiments herein may comprise a computer program product configured to include a pre-configured set of instructions, which when performed, can result in actions as stated in conjunction with the methods described above. In an example, the pre-configured set of instructions can be stored on a tangible non-transitory computer readable medium or a program storage device. In an example, the tangible non-transitory computer readable medium can be configured to include the set of instructions, which when performed by a device, can cause the device to perform acts similar to the ones described here. Embodiments herein may also include tangible and/or non-transitory computer-readable storage media for carrying or having computer executable instructions or data structures stored thereon.

Generally, program modules utilized herein include routines, programs, components, data structures, objects, and the functions inherent in the design of special-purpose processors, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Computer executable instructions, associated data structures, and program modules represent examples of the program code means for executing steps of the methods disclosed herein. The particular sequence of such executable instructions or associated data structures represents examples of corresponding acts for implementing the functions described in such steps.

The techniques provided by the embodiments herein may be implemented on an integrated circuit chip (not shown). The chip design is created in a graphical computer programming language, and stored in a computer storage medium (such as a disk, tape, physical hard drive, or virtual hard drive such as in a storage access network). If the designer does not fabricate chips or the photolithographic masks used to fabricate chips, the designer transmits the resulting design by physical means (e.g., by providing a copy of the storage medium storing the design) or electronically (e.g., through the Internet) to such entities, directly or indirectly. The stored design is then converted into the appropriate format (e.g., GDSII) for the fabrication of photolithographic masks, which typically include multiple copies of the chip design in question that are to be formed on a wafer. The photolithographic masks are utilized to define areas of the wafer (and/or the layers thereon) to be etched or otherwise processed.

The resulting integrated circuit chips can be distributed by the fabricator in raw wafer form (that is, as a single wafer that has multiple unpackaged chips), as a bare die, or in a packaged form. In the latter case the chip is mounted in a single chip package (such as a plastic carrier, with leads that are affixed to a motherboard or other higher level carrier) or in a multichip package (such as a ceramic carrier that has either or both surface interconnections or buried interconnections). In any case the chip is then integrated with other chips, discrete circuit elements, and/or other signal processing devices as part of either (a) an intermediate product, such as a motherboard, or (b) an end product. The end product can be any product that includes integrated circuit chips, ranging from toys and other low-end applications to advanced computer products having a display, a keyboard or other input device, and a central processor.

The embodiments herein can include both hardware and software elements. The embodiments that are implemented in software include but are not limited to, firmware, resident software, microcode, etc.

A data processing system suitable for storing and/or executing program code will include at least one processor coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus. The memory elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code, bulk storage, and cache memories which provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution.

Input/output (I/O) devices (including but not limited to keyboards, displays, pointing devices, etc.) can be coupled to the system either directly or through intervening I/O controllers. Network adapters may also be coupled to the system to enable the data processing system to become coupled to other data processing systems or remote printers or storage devices through intervening private or public networks. Modems, cable modem and Ethernet cards are just a few of the currently available types of network adapters.

The CPUs  **1010**  are interconnected via system bus  **1012**  to various devices such as a random access memory (RAM)  **1014** , read-only memory (ROM)  **1016** , and an input/output (I/O) adapter  **1018**. The I/O adapter  **1018**  can connect to peripheral devices, such as disk units  **1011**  and storage drives  **1013** , or other program storage devices that are readable by the system. The system  **1000**  can read the inventive instructions on the program storage devices and follow these instructions to execute the methodology of the embodiments herein. The system  **1000**  further includes a user interface adapter  **1019**  that connects a keyboard  **1015** , mouse  **1017** , speaker  **1024** , microphone  **1022** , and/or other user interface devices such as a touch screen device (not shown) to the bus  **1012**  to gather user input. Additionally, a communication adapter  **1020**  connects the bus  **1012**  to a data processing network  **1025** , and a display adapter  **1021**  connects the bus  **1012**  to a display device  **1023** , which provides a GUI  **1029**  in accordance with the embodiments herein, or which may be embodied as an output device such as a monitor, printer, or transmitter, for example. Further, a transceiver  **1026** , a signal comparator  **1027** , and a signal converter  **1028**  may be connected with the bus  **1012**  for processing, transmission, receipt, comparison, and conversion of electric or electronic signals.
