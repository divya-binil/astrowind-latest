FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary ecosystem  **100**  of participants  **102**  interconnected over a socially aware network  **104**  through a social networking platform  **106**  also referred to as social networking engine  **106**  interchangeably without limitations. As shown in FIG. 1, the ecosystem  **100**  provides the social networking platform  **106**  for device participants  **108**. One or more such devices or device participants such as a device  **108**  a, a device  **108** b, a device  **108** c, and a device  **102** d are in communication with the social networking platform (SNP)  **106**  through the network  **104**  to provide a socially aware networking facility for the devices  **108**.

In accordance with some embodiments, the devices  **108**  are autonomous and may not require human intervention. The devices  **108**  can directly exchange social content on their own without any human intervention.

However, in accordance with an embodiment, as shown in FIG. 1, the devices may not be fully autonomous and may require human intervention for certain activities. In accordance with this embodiment, each device  **108**  is associated with a non-device or human participant  **110**. As shown, the ecosystem  **100**  in an exemplary embodiment includes multiple device participants  **108**  and multiple non-device participants  **108**  each associated with a device participant  **108**. For example, the device participant  **108**  a is associated with a non-device participant  **110**  a, device participant  **108**  b is associated with a non-device participant  **110**  b, the device participant  **108**  c is associated with a non-device participant  **110**  c, and the device participant  **108**  d is associated with a non-device participant  **110**  d.

In some embodiments, a non-device participant such as  **110**  _e _may be added to the network  **104**  without it being associated with any of the device participants  **108**. For example, a physician who is not associated with any specific device as a coordinator may be associated with the social networking platform  **106**  and may, for example, function as a consultant or expert. Similarly, several other non-device participants may also join the network for social activity or social content exchange within the network  **104**  without any association with a specific device. In embodiment, the non-device participants  **110**  are human participants.

In an embodiment, the device participants  **108**  can be automated devices, or non-automated devices. In an embodiment, the devices  **108**  may not have computational capabilities and may not be able to directly communicate to a network  **104**  as a mobile phone, desktop, tablet, personal computer, cell phone, smart phone etc. can do. For example, such types of devices  **108**  can be medical devices in a healthcare environment that may not have or may partially have computation capabilities and may not be directly able to communicate to the network  **104**  for information exchange. A few examples of such devices  **108**  without limitations are thermometers, blood sugar meters, medical robots, microchip implants, prosthetic devices, pacemakers, defibrillators, magnetic resonance imaging machines, ultra sound machines, physiologic monitors, vital sign monitors, electrocardiographs, infusion pumps, ventilators, cardiac output monitors, infant incubators, blood gas analyzers, extracorporeal therapy systems, diagnostic systems, radiologic and fluoroscopic systems, mammography systems, intra aortic balloon pumps, anesthesia units, dialysis units, partially intelligent medical devices hubs, sensors or other sensor-based devices, other non-intelligent or partially intelligent medical devices, and others without limitations.

In an embodiment, the devices  **108**  can be sensors that are capable of sensing an environment. In some embodiments, the devices  **108**  may not independently perform processing and computation tasks and may be able to be networked so as to enable them to perform processing and computations tasks by linking them with processing circuits and computational units. It must be appreciated that though a primary device may not be capable of computation, it can invite smart and intelligent devices to join the network  **104**  so that the secondary devices can then join the network  **104**  and may function as a social network participant  **102**. Therefore, the ecosystem  **100**  facilitates interaction between intelligent as well as non-intelligent devices and non-device participants  **110** ; however, the ecosystem  **100**  includes at least one device participant that is potentially incapable of computations.

In an embodiment, the social networking platform  **106**  provides a facility for automation in devices networking and interconnection. In an embodiment, the devices having no computation capabilities and can also be integrated and interconnected socially through the social aware network  **104**  by the social networking platform  **106**.

In an embodiment, the social networking platform  **106**  allows the devices  **108**  to voluntarily join the social network  **104** , disassociate or leave from the social network  **104** , extend interconnection with other like-minded devices, send invitations for connections to other devices, accept or reject invitations from other devices, view profiles of connections or other devices, exchange social activity information, establish social signatures for social authorization of profiles, create devices groups, join devices groups, leave devices groups voluntarily or involuntarily upon a request by other devices, and perform various other tasks meant to be performed in a socially aware cluster of entities.

FIG. 2, with reference to FIG. 1, illustrates a social networking server  **202**  for implementing the social networking platform  **106**  in accordance with an embodiment. The social networking platform  **106**  (also referred to as a social networking engine or a system) may provide a social networking service to the plurality of participants  **102**  and allow them to perform a series of social tasks in the socially aware network  **104**. The social networking server  **202**  facilitates social information exchange among the participants  **102**  through the socially aware network  **104**. As discussed above in conjunction with FIG. 1, the plurality of participants  **102**  may include device participants  **108**  as well as non-device participants  **110**.

The server  **202**  is communicatively coupled to a social profiles manager  **204**  for creating and managing individual centric profiles of the participants  **102**  that are social representation of the individual participants  **102**  within the socially aware network  **104**. The participants  **102**  are identifiable by other participants and the social networking server  **202**  through their social profiles. The device participants  **108**  may be associated with device social profiles and the associated non-device participants  **110**  may be associated with human social profiles or non-device profiles. The human profiles or non-device profiles are associated with one or more device profiles. In some embodiments, the social human profiles are represented as subsets of the corresponding device social profiles.

FIG. 3, with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, illustrates an exemplary embodiment of social profiles of the devices  **108**  and non-device participants  **110**  that is human profiles. In some embodiments, two types of profiles may be created including a device social profile and a human social profile. The human profile may in some cases, where a human is associated as a coordinator of a device  **108**  a, be associated with a device profile so that the human social profile is a subset of the device social profile. The device social profile may include a manufacturing profile, an installation profile, an operation profile, a schedules profile, a location profile, a reliability profile, a network profile, a security profile, and a human profile. The various profile types are discussed hereafter.

The manufacturing profile associated with a device  **108**  a includes information pertaining to manufacturing, design and fabrication parameters of the device  **108**  a. This may include information such as material of the device  **108**  a, composition of the device  **108**  a, shape, size, dimensions, fabrication process, manufacturing limitations, manufacturing defects, fabrication limitations, component names, component design, components connections, design constraints, strength, factor of safety, manufacturing date, and other details relevant to the manufacturing aspects of the device  **108**  _a._

The installation profile may include details such as relevant for installation of the device  **108**  a, for example installation location, installing warranty, installation company, installation guidelines, device's association with other proximity devices, installation configurations, installation settings, electronic, electrical, or mechanical connections among the installed components, safety precautions regarding installation such as installation requirements, and the like.

The operation profile may include details relevant for post installation activities of the device  **108**  a such as its operation, functioning, coordination with other devices, routine activities of the device  **108**  a and so on. The operation profile may include details such as usage guidelines for example one time usable, twice usable etc., running time, operating parameters, operating capabilities, operating limitations, real-time operating details, historical usage, fault histories, operational faults, operating status, operating costs, battery usage, battery availability, and the like.

The location profile includes details pertaining to location characteristics and coordinates of a device such as  **108**  a for example details such as where the device  **108**  a is located, location coordinates with respect to proximate devices, and location coordinates of the proximate devices and the like.

The reliability profile includes details pertaining to reliability and safety relationships and characteristics of a device such as device  **108**  a. The reliability relationships may associate reliability standards of the device  **108**  a with a purpose of use of the device  **108**  a. For example, the device  **108**  a may be highly reliable or safe for one time use but may not be reliable or safe for another purpose. In an embodiment, reliability and safety relationships may associate a device reliability standard with a network type. For example, a high reliability highly safe device only may be allowed in one network while even a low or medium reliability device may be allowed in another network. In several embodiments, the term reliability and safety relationships may define safety critical, or life critical, or other such parameters.

The network profile includes details pertaining to network-based characteristics or relationships of a device such as the device  **108**  a. The network-based relationships may include information such as network type, network coverage, and the like. The network profile may allow accommodating device relationships but only if the device  **108**  a observes a defined network-based communication such as through a wired vs. wireless network (which may be indicative of security or reliability). For example, a social network of the devices  **108**  may allow some devices to become a part of the network in cases where traffic is going over a wired network or secure satellite but not Wi-Fi or through any other defined network.

The time profile of a device such as the device  **108**  a includes details pertaining to time coordinates of an action or a task performed by the device  **108**  a. For example, the time profile may include details such as when a device  **108**  a is in operating state and when is in idle state, when in future the device  **108**  a may be idle or functioning.

The security profile includes details pertaining to security characteristics of a device  **108**  a. The security information or details in a security profile may include security standards of the device  **108**  a such as how secured the device  **108**  a is. A device such as the device  **108**  a may, for example, be categorized as a low security device or a high security device and the like. The security profile may allow security-based relationships with other devices by associating security relationships in association with a device purpose or function. For example, the security-based relationships may accommodate how secure a device  **108**  a is for a given purpose. The security profile defines parameters and relationships such as about protecting device data, and about device privacy etc.

The risk social profile of a device  **108**  a may include individual device risk information that is indicative of how risky a device, such as  **108**  a, is for a defined operation and in a defined setting or environment. For example, a recording device in a medical environment may be considered as a low risky device and a corresponding risk social profile may include the low risk details. A diagnostic device may be considered as a low to medium risk device and a corresponding risk social profile may include the low to medium risk details of the device. A therapeutic device to deliver drugs etc. to a patient may be a high risk device and corresponding social risk profile may include the high risk details of the device. In an embodiment, the risk profile information may be identified and reviewed by the devices  **108**  so as to identify nature of association with regards to risk prior to accepting a device invitation as a connection. For example, a ventilator associated with a patient may be a high risk device and may not want to connect with a low risk device for patient safety purposes and therefore may analyze social risk profiles of the devices that send connection invitations to the ventilator or to which the ventilator sends connection requests.

In an example, the individual risk social profiles that may be predefined by the devices  **108**  or their coordinator or non-device participants  **110**  may behave differently than an aggregated social risk profile of a group containing the individual social risk profiles. For example, in an embodiment, the four devices  **108**  as shown in FIG. 1 may be associated with different risks as identified through their social profiles. However, the aggregated risk of each device in the group containing the four devices  **108**  a  **108**  d after interconnection is same. This means that the risk of all the four devices  **108**  a  **108**  d is now changed and is same for all the devices. In an example, the aggregated risk may be the risk of the highest risky device among the four devices  **108**  a  **108**  d. In an example, the aggregated risk may be calculated based on computational techniques, mathematical and analytical models, and software algorithms etc.

In some embodiments, a device such as the device  **108**  a may be associated with a non-device participant such as the non-device participant  **110**  a such as a human participant who may coordinate or control one or more functions of the device  **108**  a. For example, the non-device participant  **110**  a may stop or start the device  **108**  a. In an embodiment, the non-device participant  **110**  a may be an initiator of the device  **108**  a or task or a consumer of the device  **108**  a or an output associated with a task or device  **108**  a. The non-device participant  **110**  a may be associated with a human social profile so that the human social profile may be a sub-profile of the device social profile. The human social profile may include details pertaining to the coordinator of the device  **108**  a such as age, sex, qualification, expertise, credentialing, affiliation, and other details related to the person or the non-device participant  **110**  a associated with the device  **108**  _a._

Therefore, as discussed above, in accordance with various embodiments, the device profile may include the manufacturing profile, installation profile, operation profile, network profile, security profile, reliability profile, location profile, time profile, and a human social profile such that a first set of activities are performed by the device  **108**  a and a second set of activities are performed by the associated non-device participant  **110**  a, wherein the non-device participant  **110**  a is identified by the device profile.

In some embodiments, a human social profile may control and govern other profiles of the device  **108**  a. For example, a person defined as a coordinator of the device  **108**  a may be provided privileges to modify one or more profiles of the device  **108**  _a._

In some embodiments, the social networking server  **202**  is programmed for a multi-level profile based identification that is indicative of a device such as  **108**  a uniquely by other devices in the social networking ecosystem  **100**. The multi-level profile-based unique identification of the devices  **108**  includes identification of the devices profiles including at least one non-device profile that may be allowed to modify other profiles of the devices  **108**. The multi-level profile based identification of the devices  **108**  in the network  **104**  facilitates sequential control and monitoring of a chain of tasks and interconnected devices performing the tasks by allowing the devices  **108**  to initiate or respond to a social activity for social interaction among the devices and non-device participants  **108**  and  **110**  based on target network connection identification and directing the social activity-based messages accordingly to the uniquely identified target connection participants.

In an embodiment, a human participant such as  **110**  _e _may be allowed to join the social networking platform  **106**  upon a request by a device such as  **108**  a or a non-device participant  **110**  a associated with the device  **108**  a. In accordance with some embodiments, therefore, the social networking platform  **106**  may allow the devices  **108** , associated non-devices  **110**  and other humans such as  **110**  _e _not associated with a device to join the social networking platform  **106**  and execute social activities through the socially aware network  **104**. However, in some embodiments, it must be appreciated that the social network  **104**  includes at least two devices so as to allow devices-based interaction either directly among the devices or through an activity initiated by a an associated non-device or any third party non-device.

Referring back to FIG. 2, the social profiles manager  **204**  facilitates creating and managing individual centric profiles of the participants  **102**  that are social representation of the individual participants  **102**  within the socially aware network  **104**. In some embodiments, the profile manager  **204**  first allows creation of a base profile so that the base profile further allows creation of secondary profiles. The base profile may be a social human profile for a non-device participant such as human participant  **110**  a associated with a device such as device participant  **108**  a. The secondary profiles may be created subsequently based on a set of parameters identified by the social human profile. For example, once a human profile is created for the device  **108**  a, the device  **108**  a may be constrained to be installed, operated, and managed by the non-device participant  **110**  a in a way that fulfills the requirements identified by the social human profile of the device  **108**  a. The profile manager  **204**  provides a social interface to facilitate the non-device participant such as  **110**  a to interact with the device  **108**  a for creating the base profile and the secondary profiles. The profile manager  **204**  may link the various sub-profiles of the device  **108**  a so that each of the sub-profiles such as the operation or installation or any other sub-profile may be tied to a respective human social profile so that the device is identifiable by other devices through device specific or human profiles associated with the device profiles. The profile manager  **204**  is further discussed hereafter.

The server  **202**  further includes or is further communicatively coupled to a device or participants manager  **206**  to manage participants' relationships and social activity in the socially aware network  **104**. The device manager  **206**  may enable social settings for allowing the devices  **108**  or associated non-device participants  **110**  to interact over the social network  **104**. For example, the device manager  **206**  may allow new devices to join the network by enabling network join settings of the devices  **108**. In some embodiments, the device manager  **206**  may manage devices' social activation and deactivation that enables or disables the devices  **108**  from doing social activity or communicating through social content exchange. The device manager  **206**  may further support device profiles enablement so that the device manager  **206**  may allow visibility of the various social profiles of the devices  **108**  based on social context or type of exchange among the devices  **108**. In some embodiments, the device manager  **206**  may associate one or more social profiles of a device such as  **108**  a with the device  **108**  a so that the device  **108**  a is identifiable by other devices or non-devices. In some embodiments, the device manager  **206**  may be authorized to hide certain device profiles based on other socially active device contexts. For example, the device manager  **206**  may not allow visibility of a human social profile to a connection device and thus may hide the human social profile. In some embodiments, the device manager  **206**  may allow interaction of the devices  **108**  with the social networking server  **202**. The device manager  **206**  may further allow communicating through various network channels such as a multi-level networking channel mechanism as will be discussed later. In some embodiments, the device manager  **206**  may control device social settings. In some embodiments, the device manager  **206**  may control non-social settings such as including device operating characteristics so that the device manager  **206**  may include social platform and an operating platform wherein the operating platform controls non-social settings and the social platform controls social settings. In some embodiments, the social settings may be dependent on operating characteristics and vice versa. For example, the social platform of the device manager  **206**  may communicate social content when a social activity is triggered with a connection device upon identification of a status change in the device operating characteristics. For example, an operating platform of a heart beat monitor may receive operating information pertinent to an abnormal heart rhythm and notify the social platform of the device  **108**  a to execute a social activity initiated by the device  **108**  a with a connection ventilator so as to initiate artificial ventilation by the connection ventilator. The social and the operating platforms may be interdependent and enabled to coordinate with the social networking server  **202**  such that the device settings may be communicated to the network server  **202**.

The server further includes a social networking application  **208**  that includes a cluster of social applications each for providing a specific social facility to facilitate social activity among the device participants  **108**  through the socially aware network  **104**.

In some embodiments, the social networking application  **208**  may include a web-sharing facility  **210**  for allowing information exchange among the participants  **102**  through a web-based interface. In some embodiments, the social networking application  **208**  may include a social profiles facility  **212**  for allowing the participants  **102**  to create respective social profiles. In some embodiments, the social application  **208**  may include a notification facility  **214**  for facilitating exchange of invitation notifications for extending a participant's social space. In some embodiments, the social networking application  **208**  may include a recommendation facility  **216**  for sharing recommendations for a device such as  **108**  a based on noticed past behavior of the device  **108**  a by a connection device. In some embodiments, the social networking application  **208**  may include a prediction analytics engine  **218**  for determining participants future behavior based on historical social data about the participants  **102**. The prediction analytics engine generates information about what a device such as  **108**  a can do and how it can behave in future. In some embodiments, the social application  **208**  may include a social groups facility  **220**  for creating a social group dedicated for the participants  **102**  and exhibiting a defined behavior or belonging to a defined class. In some embodiments, the social application  **208**  may include a messaging facility  **222**  for sharing social content from a participant to another connection participant. In various embodiments, the messages can be either instant messages, or emails or other types of messages. In some embodiments, the social networking application  **208**  may include an information security facility  **224**  for encrypting and decrypting social content during exchange among the participants  **102**.

In an example, the device manager  **206**  may include or may be coupled to a risk manager  **226**  for computing the aggregated risk based on the individual risks of the individual devices such as the devices  **108**. In an example, the risk manager  **226**  may further analyze and predict risk patterns in association with device contexts or environments or device groups. The risk manager  **226**  is adapted to retrieve the social profile information corresponding to the individual devices  **108**  to determine a risk profile of the entire group and identify risk patterns of the entire group. The risk profile and risk patterns are indicative of how safe and reliable it is for a device to join the group for social information exchange or social activity or in a particular network or environment for operation. The risk manager  **226**  may provide safety interlocks, risk management capability, and risk documentation capability. The risk documentation capability may provide a facility for the devices  **108**  to update their social risk profiles based on their networking and interconnection with a group of devices having different risks. The risk documentation may be performed in the social profiles so that the updated risk may be indicated and contained within the social profiles of the devices.

FIG. 4, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 3, illustrates the server  **202**  among other things according to an embodiment herein. As shown, the social device manager  **206**  includes a relationships manager  **402**  and a relationships information storage module  **404**. The relationships manager  **402**  manages and/or updates social relationships among the devices  **108**. The relationships may be associated with the social profiles of the devices  **108**  interacting with one another. In some embodiments, the devices  **108**  may coordinate through different relationship patterns that the relationships manager  **402**  may govern. For example, the relationships manager  **402**  may manage manufacturing relationships, installation relationships, operation relationships, security relationships, reliability relationships, network relationships, time relationships, location relationships and the like. The relationships manager  **402**  may organize the different relationships among the interacting devices  **108**  in a device oriented pattern based on device oriented social profiles so that one type of device relationship gets a higher priority over another type of relationship. The relationships manager  **402**  resolves relationship conflicts among the devices  **108**  based on the relationships priorities. The device conflicts may arise in case of conflicting situations such as when one device enables a function that requires a social contribution from a second device but the second device denies contributing through the social activity. The relationships manager  **402**  assesses the social profiles-based relationships between the devices  **108**  and decides about the devices' behavior during social interactions. For example, if the relationships manager  **402**  identifies that an operation relationship between the devices  **108**  necessitates coordinated functioning; the relationships manager  **402**  facilitates the devices  **108**  to issue instructions through the social activity to facilitate interaction by the devices  **108**. However, if the security relationship warrants the security through the devices' integrated functioning, the relationships manager  **402**  may facilitate the devices  **108**  to issue an instruction based on higher priority of security relationship than the operating relationship to stop the interaction between the devices  **108**  either automatically or through an intervention by a non-device participant such as  **110**  _a._

In some embodiments, each of the social profiles associated with a device such as  **108**  a may define a social relationship so that two or more interacting devices are associated with a layered social relationship including a plurality of social profile dependent relationships with each relationship associated with a priority setting indicative of criticality of nature of relationship over other relationships.

A device such as the device  **108**  a can maintain specific and defined relationships with other devices. The relationships may comprise any type of relationship that may exist between such as two of the devices. For example, the device  **108**  a and the device  **108**  b may be like-minded, for example, both may be medical devices or more specifically both may be pacemakers from the same make, the devices  **108**  a and  **108**  b may have similar profiles, the devices  **108**  a and  **108**  b may be parts of a single operational/procedural sequence, the devices  **108**  a and  **108**  b may be used by the same person such as a patient as identified by a patient identifier associated with the devices  **108**  a and  **108**  _b._

In embodiments, the relationship manager  **402**  can track or monitor the relationships among the devices  **108**. The relationship manager  **402**  can maintain the information regarding relationships in the form of a social map, in some embodiments. The social map is discussed later in detail.

The information pertaining to the relationships among the devices  **108**  networked through the social networking server  **202**  is stored in the relationships information storage module  **404**. In an embodiment, the social relationships map can be stored in the relationships information storage module  **404**. The relationships information storage module  **404**  stores information pertaining to the social profiles in association with the social relationships and the priority settings associated with each relationship. The relationships information storage module  **404**  may for example store information pertaining to the manufacturing relationships, installation relationships, operation relationships, security relationships, reliability relationships, network relationships, time relationships, location relationships and the like.

The relationships information storage module  **404**  may include a memory circuit configured to store the information related to the devices relationships as discussed above.

The server  **202**  may further be coupled to or may include the social profiles manager  **204**  for creating and managing individual centric profiles of the participants  **102**  that are social representation of the individual participants within the socially aware network  **104**. The participants  **102**  are identifiable by other participants and the social networking server  **202**  through their social profiles. The social profiles manager  **204**  includes a profile generation engine  **406** , a profile storage module  **408** , a profile updating module  **410** , a profile aggregator  **412** , and a profiles federation engine  **414**.

The profiles generation engine  **406**  facilitates creation of the social profiles of the devices  **108**. The profiles generation engine  **406**  provides an interface for allowing a non-device participant such as  **110**  a to join a device  **108**  a with the social networking platform  **106**  by providing relevant necessary details related to the device  **108**  a and the non-device participant  **110**  a so as to initiate a social subscription through the social networking platform  **106**  for the devices  **108**. The profile generation process may require the non-device participant  **110**  a to provide at least minimum details necessary for the social profile subscription with the social networking platform  **106**. In some embodiments, the profile generation engine  **406**  necessitates the creation of human social profile by the non-device participant  **110**  a associated with the device  **108**  a and the remaining device profiles are automatically generated by uploading device manuals and documents with the networking server  **202**. In various embodiments, the social profiles generation engine  **406**  may include sub modules for generating specific device profiles associated with the device  **108**  a. For example, a manufacturing profile component may provide an interface for creating a manufacturing profile of the device  **108**  a including manufacturing parameters associated with the device  **108**  a. An installation profile component may provide an interface for creating an installation profile of the device  **108**  a including installation parameters. An operation profile component may provide an interface for generating an operation profile of the device  **108**  a. A reliability profile component may provide an interface for generating a reliability profile of the device  **108**  a. A security profile component may provide an interface for creating a security profile of the device  **108**  a. A network profile component of the device  **108**  a may provide an interface for creating a network profile of the device. A human social profile component may provide an interface for generating a social profile of the non-device participant  **110**  a associated with the device  **108**  a. In an embodiment, the social human profile component initiates the other profiles components such that when the human social profile is generated, the other profiles components are automatically initiated so as to interact with a device and/or the non-device participant for generating other device centric profiles by retrieving device related details.

In an embodiment, various types of device profiles may be created for each of the devices  **108**  that may want to be a part of the social networking architecture or SNP  **106**. For example, the device  **108**  a may want to access the social networking service or platform  **106**  and a device profile is needed prior to joining the social networking platform  **106**. The device profiles may include details such as device name, device characteristics, features and qualities, device operation and functioning, device capabilities, device architecture and components, relevant dates such as device purchase date and device expiry date, device association map with other devices, device location and so on. In some embodiments, more than one profile may be created for a single device which can be such as associated with one another. In an embodiment, the information pertaining to the device  **108**  a such as manufacturing related information, installation related information, and the operation related information may be automatically stored in a memory contained within the device  **108**  a. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the storage of the relevant device information may be performed manually by a user or an operator.

As soon as the device  **102**  a creates the profile, it becomes a member of the SNP  **106**. The device  **108**  a can now enjoy various facilities provided by the SNP  **106** , for example, coordination with other networked devices  **108** , connecting with other devices  **108** , and sharing information with other networked devices  **108**  and so on. The device  **108**  a can view permitted data about other social network members or devices  **108** , enter data about themselves and possibly others, join social network groups, and so forth. The devices  **108**  are typically members of the social networking platform  **106**.

In accordance with an embodiment, a device such as  **108**  a may inform another device such as  **108**  b or may publish data such that the other device  **108**  b can handle the data asynchronously for such purposes as information capture, analytics, or any other behavior defined by the device  **108**  b. In an embodiment, the device  **108**  a may inform another device  **108**  b directly and synchronously for such purposes as information capture or analytics or other behavior defined by the device  **108**  b. In an embodiment, the device  **108**  a may be aware of the functionality of the device  **108**  b such that the device  **108**  a may influence behavior of the device  **108**  b asynchronously. For example, an insulin pump can influence a heart rate monitor to initiate data tracking during the insulin injection. In another embodiment, the device  **108**  a may be aware of functionality of the device  **108**  b and may control behavior of the device  **108**  b synchronously. The pump can inform or communicate to all the devices  **108**  integrated through the SNP  **106**  or to its connections that might be running and associated with a patient at that time to pause during injections.

In an embodiment, the profile generation engine  **406**  may employ multi-profile architecture for creating device specific multiple social profiles as shown and discussed later in conjunction with FIG. 5. The multi-profile architecture comprises a profile application component  **502** , a device personalization component  **504** , and a presentation component  **506**. The multi-profile architecture is discussed further hereafter.

Referring back to FIG. 4, the social profiles manager further includes a device profiles storage module for storing profiles related information of the devices  **108**. The profiles storage module  **408**  may include or be coupled to a memory circuit capable of storing data. The social profiles manager  **204**  further includes a device profiles updating module  **410**  for making real time updates in the social profiles of the devices  **108**  with updates in device centric information due to device or component replacements, re-installments, device operations, security changes, reliability changes, location changes, time gaps, network changes, and changes in non-device parameters, and the like.

The social profiles manager  **204**  further includes a profiles aggregator  **412**  for aggregating multiple profiles so that the aggregated profile for multiple profiles serves as a single unified identity for a device such as  **108**  a. The unified or aggregated profile can however be federated into distinct component profiles by a federation engine  **414**  upon a request by a viewer in the social network  **104**  for example for assessing a device  **108**  a prior to joining the device  **108**  a as a connection. For example, a device such as  **108**  a may assess for like-mindedness in terms of operation parameters prior to joining a device  **108**  b by viewing operation profile.

The server  **202**  may further be programmed to facilitate the devices  **108**  or non-device participants  **110**  by providing a web interface or a social networking website  **416**  for facilitating remotely located participants  **102**  to access social profiles of the devices  **102**  and interact with the devices  **102**  by exchange of social content through the social interface  **416**. In some embodiments, the web interface  **416**  may be utilized by a processing unit (not shown in FIG. 4) for accessing a remotely located patient associated device so as to access data from the device through the social network  **104**  and monitor patient's vital parameters and accordingly control device's operations remotely.

The server  **202**  may be communicatively coupled to a communication channel  **418**  that links the server  **202**  with the socially aware network  **104**  for exchange of social content among the devices  **108**  and non-devices participants  **110**. The communication channel  **418**  may include near field and wide area network as will be discussed hereafter.

FIG. 5, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 4, illustrates a multi-profile architecture  **500**  for creating device centric multiple social profiles by the social profile generation engine  **406**. The multi-profile architecture  **500**  comprises a profile application component  **502** , a device personalization component  **504** , and a presentation component  **506**.

The application component  **502**  includes sub-components each for one specific type of profile for a device such as  **108**  a. As shown, the application component  **502**  may comprise a manufacturing profile component  **508** , an installation profile component  **510** , an operation profile component  **512** , a reliability profile component  **514** , a security profile component  **516** , a network profile component  **518** , a location profile component  **520** , and a time profile component  **522** , a risk profile component  **528**  and a human profile application component  **526**.

In some embodiments, the risk application component  **528**  creates a separate aggregated social risk profile for use by the devices  **108**  in the network  **104**  to identify risks associated with the grouped devices and accordingly makes connection decisions for extending social networking space and for social content exchange in the network  **104**. In an embodiment, the risk application component  **528**  of the server  **202**  may create or update the risk social profile based on computed aggregated risks. In an embodiment, the risk application component  **528**  of the server  **202**  may create or update the risk social profile based on devices behavior in the network  **104**  as identified through social content exchange and social activity with connection devices over time.

The application component  **502**  comprises an extendible network of libraries or extendible personalization library  **524**  wherein the libraries  **524**  include a set of templates each for creating a specific type of social profile associated with a device such as  **108**  a. The template may include tables, columns, text blocks, image blocks, audio and video blocks etc. for allowing insertion or submission of social information of the device  **108**  a by a non-device participant such as  **110**  a to create a device profile. The social information may contain images, audio clips, video clips, texts, numeric, and the like. With the use of the templates, a participant may create several profiles of the device  **108**  a in a standard form acceptable by the network  **104**.

The personalization component  **504**  allows personal and customized restructuring of the templates for defining device oriented or device required profile structure. For example, a pacemaker may require specific rearrangement in the way its profile is created so as to include cardiac rhythm parameters. The personalization component  **504**  facilitates the restructuring of the profile by implementing certain modifications using a set of keywords, and technical libraries included in the personalization component  **504**. The set of keywords and technical libraries may provide a participant to personalize profiles of the device  **108**  a using the keywords and libraries such that the personalized profiles depict device characteristics, behavior and nature uniquely.

The presentation component  **506**  comprises an extendible network of application programming interfaces (APIs) for facilitating presentation of the personalized device centric profiles through a social interface such as  **416**. The presentation component  **506**  may further include template components for allowing selection of a defined display template of the social profile. The application component  **502** , personalization component  **504** , and the presentation component  **506**  may be communicatively coupled to the social networking server  **202**  for association of the social profiles with the devices  **108**  and enabling social activity identified by the associated devices social profiles.

In an exemplary embodiment, a social profile of an infusion pump may be generated by the multi-profile architecture  **500**  of the profile generation engine  **406**  employing personalization of infusion pump parameters. In an example, an infusion pump is tied to a patient for injection and delivery of drugs. The injection pump is networked with the social networking server  **202**  by an associated non-device participant such as  **110**  a or any other coordinator. The process of networking of the infusion pump with the socially aware network  **104**  and server  **202**  is initiated after the non-device participant  **110**  a initiates a social profile generation process by using the multi profile architecture  **500**  of the profile generation engine  **406**. The profile generation engine  **406**  presents a social subscription interface for the associated person or initiator to provide device specific details through several profile specific components. With the use of the personalization component  **504** , the initiator is able to provide particular details that are specific to the infusion pump. The presentation engine  **506**  facilitates display of the federated social profile of the infusion pump which is viewable by other devices  **108**  or non-device participants  **110**  in the network  **104**.

In embodiments, the social profiles of the devices  **108**  may include information pertaining to without limitations device name, device architecture, expiry date, performance standards, device features, components and sub-components details of the devices, association map, failure rate, devices' operations and functional capabilities, purchase date, location, reliability and security data, materials and compositions, quality standards, operational characteristics, social feedback from other participants such as devices  **108**  and non-devices  **110** , social tasks timings and the like.

In an embodiment, the devices  **108**  remain connected with the SNP  **106**  all the time without interruption and may not require authentication each time prior to exchange of social content. In an embodiment, the server  **202**  may facilitate the devices  **108**  to sign in and sign out of the SNP  **106**. The sign in process may be initiated by the devices  **108**  and once a device's credentials are authenticated, the device such as  **108**  a may be allowed to enter a social space provided by the SNP  **106**  to the device  **108** a. For example, the device  **108**  a may view its profile, edit its profile, exchange profile information, view connections, initiate social activity, exchange social content, communicate with connections, display or publish content viewable publicly or by the connections, read or interpret or receive messages and social content published or communicated by the connections to the device  **108**  a, analyze the content, and perform various other social activities only after signing into the social space dedicated for the device  **108**  a by the server  **202**.

In an embodiment, a human participant such as  **110**  a associated with the device  **108**  a may act as an initiator and assist the device in connecting with the SNP  **106**  by submitting the credentials which once authenticated by the server  **202**  allows the device  **108**  a and the initiator  **110**  a to associate with the SNP  **106**  for social networking facilities such as social content exchange.

FIG. 6, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 5, illustrates the communication network  **104**  for exchange of social content between the devices  **108**  a and  **108**  b. The device  **108**  a is associated with an external controller  **602**  a and the device  **108**  b is associated with an external controller  **602**  b. Each of the external controllers  **602**  a and  **602**  b is communicatively coupled to the respective devices  **108**  a and  **108**  b. The device participants  **108**  a and  **108**  b are connected with the external controllers  **602**  a and  **602**  b through a Near Field Communication (NFC) channel  **604**. For example, the device  **108**  a communicates with the external controller  **602**  a through the NFC channel  **604**  wherein the NFC channel or network  **604**  includes an NFC point  **606**  a to connect with the external controller  **602**  a. The device  **108**  a interacts with the NFC point  **606**  a of the NFC channel  **604**  to share social content and initiate a social activity. The communication point of the NFC channel  **604**  receives the social content transmitted by the device  **108**  a and transfers the social content to the external controller  **602**  a. The external controller  **602**  a is communicatively coupled to the socially aware network or social network  **104**. In an embodiment, the devices  **108**  a and  **108**  b may include or be coupled to sensing units wherein the sensing and monitoring units are communicatively coupled to the external controllers  **602**  a and  **602**  b for communicating with the Near Field Communication point  **606**  a of the Near Field Communication channel  **604**.

The social activity from the device  **108**  a through the NFC network  **604**  automatically triggers a socially aware network point  **608**  of the socially aware network  **104**  so that the social content transmitted during the social activity results in the external controller  **602**  a to further transmit the social content through the socially aware network point  **608**  of the social network channel  **104**  for socially sharing the social content to the remotely located participants including devices and non-devices participants. The social content received at the socially aware network point  **608**  is transmitted through the socially aware network  **104**  to the external controller  **602**  b associated with the device  **108**  b. The reception of the social content by the external controller  **602**  b through the social network point  **608**  automatically triggers the 'Near Field Interaction Point'  **606**  b of the Near Field Communication Network  **604**  for socially sharing the social content to the remotely located device  **108**  b associated with the external controller  **602**  b through the social networking server  **202**.

In an embodiment, the NFC network  **604**  is a short range communication network, wherein range of the NFC  **604**  is 100 meters so that the device  **108**  a is located within proximity of 100 meters from the external controller  **602**  a to communicate the social content with the external controller  **602**  a. In an embodiment, the NFC network  **604**  is a Bluetooth™ network.

In an embodiment, the NFC  **604**  is a short range communication network, wherein range of the NFC network  **604**  is approximately thirty feet so that the device  **108**  a is located within an approximate proximity of thirty feet from the external controller  **602**  a to communicate the social content with the external device  **108**  a. In an embodiment, the NFC network  **604**  is based on a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system such that the device  **108**  a includes an RFID tag capable of being read by a reader communicatively coupled to or included within the external controller  **602**  _a._

In an embodiment, the NFC network  **604**  is a Body Area Network (BAN) or a wireless sensor network associated with the devices  **108**  that are wearable by a patient in some embodiments. The BAN includes a gateway to reach the social aware network  **104**  through the external controller  **602**  a. The BAN includes monitoring sensors, motion detectors, and other sensing circuits associated with a subject. The BAN is further linked communicatively to a processing circuit and includes a power source and a transceiver (not shown) for communicating the social content to the external controller  **602**  a through the gateway. The devices  **108**  include NFC tags programmable by NFC applications.

In an embodiment, the socially aware network  **104**  is a wide network such as a Wi-Fi or internet such that the network allows interconnection and automation among the plurality of remotely located participants such as  **108**  a and  **108**  b and between the participants  **108**  and the social networking server  **202**.

The social activity or social tasks may include devices  **108**  to voluntarily join the social network  **104** , disassociate or leave from the social network  **104** , extend interconnection with other like-minded devices, send invitations for connections to other devices  **108** , accept or reject invitations from other devices  **108** , view social profiles of other devices  **108** , exchange social activity information, establish social signatures for social authorization of profiles, create devices social groups, join devices groups, and leave devices groups voluntarily and non-voluntarily through an action of a participant  **102**. In an embodiment, the socially aware network  **104**  is a distributed network to allow interconnection and automation among the devices  **108**  distributed in a plurality of medical environments, or other high reliability and safety critical environments such as avionics, manufacturing, automotives and the like.

In an embodiment, the socially aware network  **104**  is a private and dedicated network for a medical environment or other high reliability and safety critical environments such as avionics, manufacturing, automotives and the like.

In some embodiments, at least a first device participant is independently incapable of performing computation tasks. In some embodiments, a device participant is connected with a second device participant that is incapable of performing computation tasks, a third device participant that is partially capable of performing computation tasks, a fourth smart device that is independently capable of performing computation tasks and a non-device participant associated with one of the device participants, wherein the first device participant transfers the social content to the second device, third device, fourth device and the non-device participant through the NFC channel  **604**  and the socially aware network  **104** , wherein the socially aware network  **104**  is automatically triggered upon receipt of the social content by the NFC interaction point  **606**  a or  **606**  _b._

In an embodiment, the devices  **108**  can associate them with the SNP  **106**  or server  **202**  by creating an initial profile as discussed above so that the devices  **108**  are a part of the SNP  **106**. The devices  **108**  that are interconnected together through the SNP  **106**  can share the social content by initiating a social activity and are referred to as social connections. For example, if a pacemaker P **1**  connects to another pacemaker P **2** , and a ventilator V, the pacemaker P **1**  is said to include two connections—pacemaker P **2**  and ventilator V. Once the pacemaker P **1**  is connected to its two connections, it is free to share information with them and also to receive information from them upon initiation of a social activity by them. In an example, FIG. 7, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 6, illustrates an implantable medical device (IMD)  **702**  such as a pacemaker fitted inside a body of a patient  **704**. The pacemaker  **702**  is connected to an external controller  **706**  (which can be configured as the external controller  **602**  a or  **602**  b) that can be configured to communicate remotely to the communication channel  **604**  of the SNP  **106**  as discussed in conjunction with FIG. 6 above. The IMD  **702**  (IMD  **702**  can be any of the devices  **108** ) can connect and share the information to another device such as  **108**  a that is a member of the SNP  **106**. The IMD  **702**  can include components such as various sensors that can record data and/or monitor the performance of the IMD  **702**  and communicate it to the external controller  **706**  which can then transmit it to the server  **202**  and to another connection device such as  **108**  b. In an embodiment, the data thus shared can be publicly announced and displayed over the profile of the IMD  **702**. In another embodiment, the data can be shared only to respective connections of the IMD  **702**  only.

It should be appreciated that FIG. 7 illustrates an example of the IMD  **702**  as a medical device. In a similar manner, several other types of devices can also communicate among themselves through the SNP  **106**  or server  **202**. In an embodiment, the devices  **108**  can include various types of sensors and other monitoring devices. The sensors and the monitoring devices can collect and retrieve relevant information stored initially with the devices  **108**  or recorded over a period of performance. The retrieved information can be stored within a memory space of a device such as  **108**  a. The devices  **108**  can manipulate the information that belongs to them such that they can share it to the connections, view it as and when they like or need, retrieve it as a historical data for analysis, display it publicly on the SNP website, hide it from viewing by others, hide it from viewing by others except connections, populate the profile data, and so on.

In an embodiment, the device  **108**  a can connect with the SNP  **106**  and announce itself privately or publicly. Once connected, the device profile can be publicly or privately viewable by other devices or selected devices that are members of the SNP  **106**. In an embodiment, a device  **108**  a can connect with another device  **108**  b with whom the device  **108**  a is interested to work with. For example, if the IMD  **702**  wants to work with some other like-minded device such as a defibrillator, the IMD  **702**  can send a request for connection and can connect once the request is accepted. In an embodiment, the sending and accepting of requests can be manually intervened or controlled by a user such as the patient  **704**  or his doctor who may or may not be an SNP participant. In another embodiment, the sending and accepting of requests can be automatically processed. For this, specific programming can be performed within the external programmer  **706**  of the IMD  **702**. For example, the external programmer  **706**  can be programmed to send invitations to a like-minded device as it connects over the SNP  **106**. The programmer  **706**  stores relevant data and instructions and issues commands.

In an embodiment, the medical device such as the IMD  **702**  can include a RFID chip (not shown) that is configured to store information relevant to the IMD  **702**. The information can be read by a reader that can be integrated within the external controller or programmer  **706**  or in any other external device. As and when any information is transmitted from the IMD  **702**  to the SNP  **106**  or social networking server  **202** , the reader decodes the RFID tag within the IMD  **702**  and associates the data with the relevant information. Therefore, the server  **202**  can automatically identify the IMD  **702**  and can grant permission to the profile of the IMD  **702**. Subsequently, the process of information sharing can occur automatically. Similarly, several other devices  **108**  can be associated with their pertinent information, data and metadata and can accordingly be updated. In several other embodiments, various other communication mechanisms may be employed for exchange of social content and/or sharing of social invitations.

In an embodiment, the device such as IMD  **702**  can find like-minded devices for extending a social network based on parameters such as profiles of a community of the devices using it, for example, a web based data processing system  **708**  that can be directly through wire or wirelessly or remotely connected to the device  **702**. The data processing system  **708**  can be integrated within or communicatively coupled with the external programmer  **706**  and can interface remotely to the SNP  **106**  or server  **202**. The data processing system  **708**  can perform functions such as query a database of profiles of the devices  **108**  such as of a community of the devices  **108**. The query can include information pertinent to a device such as device  **108**  a and could include, without limitations, the name of the device  **108**  a, identifier of the device  **108**  a, type of the device  **108**  a, medical conditions treated by the device  **108**  a, therapies delivered by the device  **108**  a, patient identifier associated with the device  **108**  a, life style factors associated with a patient associated with the device  **108**  a, environmental factors, contextual factors, historical records stored in the device  **108**  a, and so on. Upon searching, the device  **108**  a can perform various functions such as view the matching profiles, connect with them, post messages for them, like or dislike their posts, use their data upon request, share information with them, and perform further queries or refine the queries or share other social content.

In an embodiment, the data processing system  **708**  as discussed above can work in a completely automated manner along with the devices  **108**  with the use of various technologies implemented thereon such as RFID, bar code identification, wireless and wired mode of information sharing, sensor based actions and reactions, BAN, and so on without limitations. This can be achieved without any manual intervention. In another embodiment, a limited or complete manual intervention may be involved. For example, the devices  **108**  can be associated with their patients or physicians, or other responsible persons and they can operate and control the devices interactivity with the server  **202**.

FIG. 8, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 7, illustrates a method flowchart for integration of a plurality of participants  **102**  including a plurality of devices  **108**  and non-devices  **110**  through the social networking platform  **106**. At step  **802** , the method includes creating a device centric social profile for each of the plurality of devices  **108**. The profile is a social representation of a respective device such as  **108**  a within the socially aware network  **104**  and the device  **108**  a is identifiable by other devices  **108**  and the social networking server  **202**  through the devices social profiles. At step  **804** , the method further includes allowing the exchange of social content among the devices  **108**  by the social networking server  **202**  for the devices  **108**  to perform a series of social tasks. The social content is exchanged through a first communication channel and a second communication channel. The first communication channel links a device  **108**  a with an external controller such as  **602**  a and the second communication channel links the external controller  **602**  a with the socially aware network  **104**. In embodiments, the first communication channel may include a Bluetooth™ network, RFID-based network or a Body Area Network or Body Sensor Network. The second communication channel may include a wide area network such as the Internet or Wi-Fi or the socially aware network  **104**  as discussed above. The social tasks may include one or more of voluntarily joining the social network  **104** , disassociating or leaving from the social network  **104** , extending interconnection with other like-minded devices, sending invitations for connections to other devices  **108** , accepting or rejecting invitations from other devices  **108** , viewing profiles of other devices  **108** , exchanging social activity information, establishing social signatures for social authorization of profiles, creating devices social groups, joining devices groups, and leaving devices groups voluntarily or upon initiation of an activity by a participant  **102**.

At step  **806** , the method may include maintaining profiles relationships among the devices  **108**  within the socially aware network  **104**. The relationships may be of several types as already discussed above in conjunction with various figures. The social relationships may be maintained in the form of a social map as will be discussed later.

In an embodiment, the methods above are performed in the network  **104**  of devices  **108**  that include at least one device with partially incapable computation capabilities. The device with partially incapable computation capabilities is connected with an external controller through the first communication channel so that a communication point of the first channel is adapted to receive social content in real-time from the device. The second channel allows information sharing between the external controller and the social networking server  **202**.

In some embodiments, at least some of the devices interconnected through the social networking server  **202**  for social content exchange are associated with patients wherein the medical devices associated with the patients monitor vital signs of patients or perform defined functions for health management. Exemplary medical devices without limitations have been discussed above.

The method may comprise facilitating a web-based activity among the plurality of devices  **108**  for sharing the social content. The method may comprise storing information pertaining to an associated relationship of a device  **108**  a with other devices. The method may comprise facilitating the recommendation of a connection device by another device based on noticed past behavior of the connection device by the other device. The method may comprise encrypting and decrypting the social content during exchange of the social content among the devices  **108**. The method may comprise federating the profile into a respective installation social profile, manufacturing social profile, operation social profile, schedules social profile, network social profile, security social profile, reliability social profile, human social profile, time social profile, and the location social profile.

FIG. 9, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 8, illustrates a method flowchart for integration of a plurality of participants  **102**  including a plurality of devices  **108**  and non-devices  **110**  through the social networking platform  **106**  or server  **202** , in accordance the embodiments herein.

At step  **902** , the method includes creating a device centric social profile for each of the plurality of devices  **108**. The profile is a social representation of a respective device such as  **108**  a within the socially aware network  **104**  and the device such as device  **108**  a is identifiable by other devices and the social networking server  **202**  through the profile. At step  **904** , the method includes sending a connection invitation by a first device  **108**  a to a second device  **108**  b through the multi-communication channel including the first Near Field Communication (NFC) channel  **604**  and the socially aware network  **604**. The step  **904**  of sending of the invitation includes sending of the invitation from the first device  **108**  a to the external controller  **602**  a associated with the first device  **108**  a through the first NFC channel  **604** , transferring the invitation from the external controller  **602**  a to the network point  **608**  of the socially aware network  **104** , and transferring of the invitation from the network point  **608**  through the socially aware network  **104**  to the device  **108**  b. At step  **906** , the method may include accepting or rejecting the connection invitation by the second device  **108**  b upon receipt of the invitation by the second device  **108**  b. At step  **908** , the method may include maintaining a profiles relationship of the first device  **108**  a and the second device  **108**  b based on acceptance or rejection of the connection invitation by the second device  **108**  _b._

At step  **910** , the method includes allowing the exchange of social content through a social activity between the first device  **108**  a and the second device  **108**  b based on the maintained profile relationships. The social activity includes a series of social tasks including one or more of: devices  **108**  to voluntarily join the social network  **104** , disassociate or leave from the social network  **104** , extend interconnection with other like-minded devices, send invitations for connections to other devices  **108** , accept or reject invitations from other devices  **108** , view profiles of other devices  **108** , exchange social activity information, establish social signatures for social authorization of profiles, create devices social groups, join devices groups, and leave devices groups voluntarily or upon initiation of an activity by a participant  **102** , and the like without limitations.

FIG. 10, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 9, illustrates an ecosystem  **1000**  for facilitating sequential, synchronous and automatically coordinated operation of the plurality of devices  **108**  through interactive elements involving a chain of tasks and devices  **108**. The ecosystem  **1000**  includes the social networking platform  **106**  implemented through the social networking server  **202**. The plurality of devices  **108**  are interconnected and coupled with the server  **202**  through the socially aware network  **104**. The socially aware network  **104**  and the communication channel for interconnection of the devices  **108**  and the server  **202**  may be enabled in ways that are discussed above without limitations.

FIG. 10 shows a first device  **108**  a, a second device  **108**  b, a third device  **108**  c, and a fourth device  **108**  d which perform a first task  **1002** - **1** , a second task  **1002** - **2** , a third task  **1002** - **3** , and a fourth task  **1002** - **4**  respectively. The devices  **108**  are identified through their respective social profiles as shown in the figure. The interactive chain of elements includes the social profiles, tasks, and devices as shown in the figure.

The social networking server  **202**  provides a social networking service to the plurality of devices  **108**  so that each of the plurality of devices  **108**  are connected to the social networking service by associating the respective social profiles with the social networking server  **202**. The respective social profiles are social representation of the devices  **108**. The social networking server  **202**  is programmed to allow the devices  **108**  to coordinate for a synchronous social times-based functioning. The server  **202**  is programmed to associate connection-type social device relationships between the devices  **108**. The connection type social relationship is established after at least two devices accept one another as trustworthy connections after reviewing the social profiles. The trustworthiness may be defined based on factors such as like-mindedness of the devices  **108** , related functioning, completeness of tasks  **1002** , and the like. The server  **202**  may, for example, be programmed to provide a facility or an interface to the first device  **108**  a for allowing the first device  **108**  a to send a connection invitation request to the second device  **108**  b. Once the invitation request is accepted by the second device  **108**  b, the first device  **108**  a and the second device  **108**  b can form a part of the interactive chain of the devices  **108**  and tasks  **1002** - **1**  through  **1002** - **4** , wherein the server  **202**  may be programmed to provide a facility to the first device  **108**  a and the second device  **108**  b to allow them to coordinate with one another through a social activity processed by the server  **202**.

The server  **202**  is programmed to receive the social content from the first device  **108**  a once the first device  **108**  a has established the connection-type relationship with another device such as the second device  **108**  b. The social content may include several instructions for the second device  **108**  b. For example, in an embodiment, the social content may include an instruction for the second device  **108**  b to cause a synchronous and non-conflicting performance between the first device  **108**  a and the second device  **108**  b. The synchronous and non-conflicting performance is discussed below in detail with examples of the four devices shown in FIG. 10 in a medical environment. However, it should be appreciated that several other devices may also be included in the interactive chain from medical environments, or other environments such as avionics, power, automotive, and the like. The devices  **108**  can be located within a single environment or distributed in several environments.

The first, second, third, and fourth tasks  **1002** - **1**  through  **1002** - **4**  indicate elements of a complete treatment function that a patient is operated with. The first task  **1002** - **1**  and the second task  **1002** - **2**  are performed simultaneously for the first 10 minutes for a patient with defined characteristics. The first task  **1002** - **1**  then stops and the third task  **1002** - **3**  begins which continues along with the second task  **1002** - **2**  for another 10 minutes after which the second task  **1002** - **2**  stops. The third task  **1002** - **3**  still continues for another 15 minutes unless the patient body shows undesirable physiological indications. If the physiological parameters sensed are not satisfactory, then the fourth task  **1002** - **4**  begins along with the third task  **1002** - **3**. In view of the various tasks required to be performed in a defined sequence and for defined time periods based on the patient's physiological characteristics, the various devices  **108**  from those shown are made to function. For example, in accordance with the above sequence, the first device  **108**  a and the second device  **108**  b operate for the first ten minutes simultaneously. The first device  **108**  a then stops and the third device  **108**  c starts functioning. The second device  **108**  b and the third device  **108**  c operate in parallel for another 10 minutes. The second device  **108**  b then stops and the third device  **108**  c still operates for another 15 minutes unless the patient's body shows undesirable physiological parameters. If the physiological parameters sensed are not satisfactory, then the fourth device  **108**  d starts functioning along with the third device  **108**  _a._

In accordance with the synchronous functioning of the four devices  **108** , the first device  **108**  a may first need to locate the other three devices within the socially aware network  **104**. The server  **202**  may be programmed to allow the devices  **108**  to create their social profiles and subscribe with the social networking platform  **106**  for social activity. The first device  **108**  a with the first social profile may be programmed by a coordinator to function in a defined manner for a defined patient to perform a set of first tasks and a set of second tasks in a defined sequence avoiding certain conflicts. The set of first tasks are primary tasks that are performed by the first device  **108**  a itself. The set of second tasks are required to be performed by other devices. Based on the programmed instructions, the first device  **108**  a identifies that the second, third and fourth tasks  **1002** - **2** ,  **1002** - **3** ,  **1002** - **4**  are to be performed by other devices. The first device  **108**  a may be programmed with device characteristics and specifications that can perform the respective second, third and fourth tasks  **1002** - **2** ,  **1002** - **3** ,  **1002** - **4**. The server  **202**  is programmed to allow the first device  **108**  a to initiate a search request, as soon as the first device  **108**  a is connected with the social networking server  **202** , for social profiles that indicate similar capabilities of devices as the device programmed instructions include for the devices  **108**  to perform the second, third and fourth tasks  **1002** - **2** ,  **1002** - **3** ,  **1002** - **4**. The first device  **108**  a shares the social content that includes a social description of the devices required to link with the first device  **108**  a to perform a set of tasks for coordinated operation. The server  **202**  is programmed to receive the social content and perform a search within the socially aware network  **104**  to locate social profiles that are fit to coordinate with the first device  **108**  a. The server  **202**  may identify several profiles and share the profiles with the first device  **108**  a. Alternatively, the server  **202**  may shortlist the profiles and share the three profiles corresponding to the second, third, and fourth devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d only with the first device  **108**  a. In the first case, a manual intervention may be needed by a device coordinator to shortlist the best profiles. Alternatively, the device  **108**  a may also be programmed to shortlist the necessary profiles.

The server  **202**  is programmed to facilitate the first device  **108**  a to initiate a social activity with the second, third, and fourth devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d. The social activity begins by sending a social message from the first device  **108**  a to the other three devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d that include a social connection invitation request. The server  **202**  receives the social content that is indicative of the social connection request with the second, third, and fourth devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d. In an example, the request may be sent separately to the three devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d. In another example, a unified social invitation request may be broadcasted in a single social message to the three devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d. The server  **202**  may be programmed to notify the three devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d of the social message or content from the first device  **108**  a. The social content may also display a social profile of the first device  **108**  a so that the three devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d may identify and decide whether the devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d are capable and available enough to support the first device  **108**  a in performing the patient treatment tasks synchronously and in a non-conflicting manner as desired by the first device  **108**  a. The server  **202**  may further be programmed to allow the three devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d to accept or reject the invitation based on the availability and capability of the three devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d to support the first device  **108**  a in performing the patient treatment tasks as defined by the first device  **108**  a in the invitation request. In an embodiment, the invitation request may not include the information pertinent to the social tasks and the patient treatment tasks. In such cases, the accepting or rejecting of the invitation may simply depend on whether the devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d want to accept or reject the invitation based on the programmed guidelines of the devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d such as like-mindedness, historical contextual behavior of the social interaction, and the like. In an example, a human intervention may be needed to accept or reject the invitation. The server  **202**  may be programmed to provide a user interface to the three devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d to allow a coordinator to view the information contained in the social invitation request and also allow the coordinator to accept or reject the invitation. The server  **202**  may be programmed to personalize the user interface contextually based on the nature of device  **108**  a. The server  **202**  may include a personalization engine which may implement a set of executable specifications to personalize the interface for the type of device using social profiles information of the device  **108**  a. The server  **202**  may also store a list of graphic tools, a set of keywords, a medical dictionary, a medical database, tables, charts, histograms etc that can be used repeatedly in context of the devices social profiles to execute the specifications for personalizing the interface. For example, the interface for a heart beat monitor may be different from an interface for a ventilator or a pacemaker or drug delivery setup, and the like.

If one or more of the devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d reject the invitations, the first device  **108**  a may reinitiate a search request and send invitations to other devices if available in the network  **104**  or else will notify an operator about no device being available.

If the devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d accept the notification, the three devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d become connections of the first device  **108**  a. The server  **202**  is programmed to update the social profile of the first device  **108**  a to include the second, third, and fourth devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d as connections in the updated social profile. An application component enabled by the server  **202**  similar to the application component  **502**  discussed above may create a user interface or modify the social profile user interface of the first device  **108**  a as a coordinator of the first device  **108**  a to view a connection screen section on the user interface, wherein the connection screen section indicates a list of connections (the three devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d) of the first device  **108**  a and also list titles of the connection generated based on their social profiles. The server  **202**  may be programmed to allow the coordinator to personalize the connection screen section of the first device  **108**  a to view from a set of available fields on the user interface such as title field, device name, device capabilities, device state (idle, busy, do not disturb, away etc.), and the like. For example, the away state may indicate that the device is not available and is out for maintenance, idle state may be indicative of the device to be available to support a device in a chain of patient treatment tasks, busy state may be indicative of the device to be already busy in performing a treatment task for a patient, and the like.

The server  **202**  is programmed to allow the first device  **108**  a to initiate a social activity by sending social content for requesting the other three devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d to interact with the first device  **108**  a to perform the patient treatment task as is discussed above as an example. The first device  **108**  a sends out the social content to each of the three devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d indicative of the details of the respective tasks to be performed by the three devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d. For example, the social content for the second device  **108**  b may be indicative of the action or task performed by the first device  **108**  a and an instruction to the second device  **108**  b to perform an action in association with action timelines, wherein the action timelines are indicative of time points associated with the action and define time when actual action should occur at the second device  **108**  b. The server  **202**  is programmed to receive the social content indicative of the social action performed by the first device  **108**  a and the instruction to the second device  **108**  b to perform the action in association with action timelines, wherein the action timelines are indicative of time points associated with the action and define time when actual action should occur at the second device  **108**  b. The server  **202**  is programmed to notify the second device  **108**  b of the social content received from the first device  **108**  a that includes the instruction to the second device  **108**  b to perform the action in association with the action timelines. Similarly, the server  **202**  receives social content to be notified to the third and the fourth devices  **108**  c and  **108**  d. The second, third, and fourth devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d upon receipt of the instruction sends a confirmation request to the first device  **108**  a to guarantee performance of their respective actions at the defined timelines. In an example, prior to sending the social content to the devices, the first device  **108**  a or the associated coordinator may view the status of the devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d so that the first device  **108**  a may identify which device is available and idle at a time indicated by the social timelines. This increases the probability of the devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d to be available and confirm for their actions performance at the social timelines.

In an example, the devices  **108**  are associated with respective external controllers similar to  **602**  a that allow interconnection of the devices  **108**  with the social networking server  **202**  to allow social activity through the social networking service.

As discussed above, in an example, the server  **202**  is further programmed to provide a facility to the first device  **108**  a to allow the first device  **108**  a to initiate a search request for like-minded devices based on information contained in the social profile of the first device  **108**  a and current operating characteristics of the first device  **108**  a. The server  **202**  may be programmed to search for the like-minded devices from the plurality of devices  **108**  and provide a list of the like-minded devices including their social profiles and network links for the like-minded devices so as to allow the first device  **108**  a to send a connection request to one or more of the searched like-minded devices. The one or more devices are shortlisted by an external controller such as  **602**  a in association with information stored in the external controller  **602**  a and the current operating characteristics of the first device  **108**  a or through an intervention of a social human coordinator of the device  **108**  a as identified by the device social profile.

The devices  **108**  can vary in terms of their computation capabilities as discussed earlier.

In an example, each of the plurality of devices  **108**  are connected to a sensing and monitoring unit for monitoring and recording device activities for social exchange through the social activity.

In an example, the social activities includes posting a connection request for the second, third or fourth devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c,  **108**  d for associating a relationship with the three devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c,  **108**  d and cause a synchronous and non-conflicting performance between the first device  **108**  a and the other three devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c,  **108**  d. The social activities can include accepting or rejecting a connection invitation by the devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c,  **108**  d in response to a request sent by the first device  **108**  a for associating a relationship with the three devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c,  **108**  d toward a synchronous and non-conflicting performance between the first device  **108**  a and the other devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c,  **108**  d

FIG. 11, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 10, illustrates an example of the ecosystem  **1000**  of FIG. 10 in an embodiment herein. As shown, the device  **108**  a is connected with the external controller  **602**  that is adapted to communicate with the device  **108**  a through the NFC communication channel  **604**  via the NFC point  **606**  a. The NFC point  **606**  a and the NFC  **604**  have been discussed earlier in detail. The external controller  **602**  a may be coupled communicatively with the social networking server  **202**  through the socially aware network  **104**  (not shown in FIG. 11). In an embodiment, the device  **108**  a is communicatively connected to the respective external controller  **602**  a through the Near Field Communication (NFC) channel  **604**  so that the communication point  **606**  a of the NFC channel  **604**  receives the social content from the first device  **108**  a and transfers the social content to the external controller  **602**  a. The external controller  **602**  a is further communicatively coupled to the network point  **608**  of the socially aware network  **104** , wherein when one of the socially aware network points  **608**  and the NFC point  **606**  a receives the social content, the other is automatically activated to further communicate the social content. The socially aware network  **104**  can be a private network or a distributed network as discussed earlier. For example, the socially aware network  **104**  is a private and dedicated network for a medical environment so that the server  **202**  allows the first device  **108**  a to send a connection notification to the second device  **108**  b via the socially aware network point  **608**  and the NFC point  **606**  a, and once the second device  **108**  b accepts the connection notification, the first device  **108**  a sends the social content to the second device  **108**  b via the socially aware network point  **608**  and NFC point  **606**  a, wherein the social content is indicative of an action to be performed by the second device  **108**  b at a social event timeline specified by the social content. In an example, the socially aware network  **104**  is a distributed network so that the server  **202**  allows the first device  **108**  a to send a connection notification to the second device  **108**  b via the socially aware network point  **608**  and the NFC point  **606**  a, and once the second device  **108**  a accepts the connection notification, the first device  **108**  a sends the social content to the second device  **108**  b via the NFC and socially aware network points  **608**  and  **606**  a, wherein the social content is indicative of an action to be performed by the second device  **108**  b at a social event timeline specified by the social content.

The social networking server  **202**  also includes or is coupled to a social map generator  **1102**. The social map generator  **1102**  generates the social graph among the interactive chain of the tasks and the devices  **108**  based on connection relationships among the plurality of devices  **108** , wherein the social map includes a set of nodes that are representative of devices  **108**  and a set of edges connecting the nodes that are representative of relationships between the connected devices  **108**. An edge length may represent proximity between the devices  **108**.

In accordance with the illustrated embodiment, the social networking server  **202**  (also simply referred to as server interchangeably throughout the document) includes or is coupled to a processing unit  **1104**  configured to execute the programmed instructions of the server  **202**. The processing unit  **1104**  further processes the social graph for a device to identify proximity of the interconnected devices  **108**.

In an embodiment, the server  **202**  may be coupled to the social device manager  **206**. The social device manager  **206**  includes a relationship manager  **402**  (of FIG. 4) for associating a relationship of the first device  **108**  a with the other devices after the second, third, and the fourth devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d accept the connection invitations sent out by the first device  **108**  a. The relationships may indicate association of the one or more devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d with the first device  **108**  a in several forms such as a manufacturing relationship, installation relationship, operation relationship, network relationship, security relationship, reliability relationship, schedules relationship, location relationship, time relationship, and the like. The relationships may be established by the server  **202**  to avoid conflict during coordinated functioning of the devices  **108**. For example, if the first device  **108**  a does not support a low reliability device for a patient in a defined physiological state because of age and criticality parameters of the patient, the third device  **108**  c that may be a low reliability device may not be used for the defined patient. However, the device  **108**  c may still be interconnected with the first device  **108**  a for another patient treatment function for a younger patient where the low reliability is not such an issue. Such types of relationships are established to facilitate the server  **202**  to allow interconnection for a patient treatment process or function involving a chain of devices and tasks elements.

The established relationships are stored in the relationships information storage module  **404**  communicatively connected with the server  **202**. The storage module  **404**  may include a memory circuit. The server  **202**  may be communicatively coupled to the social profiles manager  **204**. The social profiles manager  **204**  has been discussed earlier.

In an example, the devices  **108**  may be programmed to function in accordance with the programmed instructions of the server  **202**  to facilitate social information or content exchange through social activities facilitated by the server  **202**. The first device  **108**  a is associated with a sensing and monitoring unit  **1106**  for monitoring and recording device activities for social exchange through the social activity. Similarly, other devices may also be associated with monitoring and sensing units. The sensing unit  **1106**  detects a change in performance state of the device  **108**  a and generates an input signal. The first device  **108**  a further includes a database  **1108**  to store operation and performance parameters of the first device  **108**  a in association with coordination and conflicting data with connection devices of the first device  **108**  a. For example, the database  **1108**  of the first device  **108**  a may include the chain of tasks and devices  **108**  involved in a patient treatment process in association with specific social timelines. The database  **1108**  also stores operation and performance characteristics and parameters of the first device  **108**  a. The external controller  **602**  a associated with the first device  **108**  a processes the generated input signal and correlates the detected signal with information stored in the database  **1108**  and generates a second signal. The second signal includes the social content and is indicative of the action performed by the first device  **108**  a at specific timelines and instructions for the second, third, and fourth devices  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d to perform specific functions at defined social timelines to facilitate the coordinated functioning of the devices  **108**  to complete the patient treatment process.

In an example, the devices  **108**  are associated with a switch matrix  **1110**  that causes the devices  **108**  to change their operating state based on the social content requesting a change in the operating state at specific social timelines.

In an embodiment, each of the devices  **108**  includes or is coupled to a health monitoring unit  **1112**  that monitors health parameters of the respective devices  **108**  and compares with threshold health parameters of the devices  **108**  to ascertain health status of the devices  **108**. The health monitoring unit  **1112**  generates a signal indicative of the health status below the threshold limit when the ascertained health status is indicative of a health below a threshold limit. The server  **302**  allows the devices  **108**  to initiate social activities that include communicating the health status to a set of connection devices so the connection devices switches to tasks performed by the devices  **108**  in case of a health failure of the devices  **108**. In an example, the health parameters of the devices  **108**  are identified by monitoring a set of patient's physiological parameters that are controlled by the devices  **108** , wherein a drop in desired physiological state of the patient is indicative of a health failure of the devices  **108**  that operate on the patient.

In some embodiments, the social activities include posting a search request for identification and receiving profile information of an adjacent device in the sequential and synchronous operation in response to the search request by a device  **108**  a, wherein upon receipt of the profile information, the device  **108**  a sends a connection request to the adjacent device. In an example, the adjacent device may be identified by the processing unit with the use of the social map. In some embodiments, the social activities include posting a search request for identification and receiving profile information of related devices in response to the search request by a device  **108**  a, wherein upon receipt of the profile information, the device  **108**  a sends a connection request to one or more of the related devices. In examples, each action performed by a device  **108**  a connected through the social networking server  **202**  is associated with a social action timeline indicative of when particular actions occur at devices  **108** , wherein the social action timelines are communicated to respective connection devices for integrating devices synchronous actions. In an example, the information pertinent to the social action timelines associated with actions to occur at the devices  **108**  may be stored in the devices social profiles.

FIG. 12, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 11, illustrates a list of exemplary social activities without limitations that the server  **202**  may be programmed to allow the devices  **108**  to perform. A shown, the social activities may include joining or subscribing with the social networking platform  **106**  or the social networking server  **202**  that enables the networking platform  **106** , disassociation from the social networking platform  **106**  or server  **202** , extending interconnection with like-minded devices, sending invitations for connections to the devices  **108** , accepting or rejecting invitations, viewing profiles of the devices  **108** , posting a search request, exchanging social activity information, establishing social signatures for devices social authorization prior to making a social decision such as accepting or rejecting a social invitation, creating devices social groups, joining devices social groups, leave devices social groups, communicate health status to a set of connection devices, and the like without limitations.

FIG. 13, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 12, illustrates an example of a social map showing interconnection of exemplary devices through the social map. The social map is generated by the social map generator  **1102**  based on the connection relationships among the devices. The social map includes a set of nodes that are representative of the devices and a set of edges connecting the nodes that are representative of relationships between the connected devices. An edge length may represent proximity between the devices. The processing unit  **1104**  may be programmed to interpret the social map and generate a signal that is indicative of such as without limitations number of connections for a device, location of the connection devices from the device, list or priority devices with respect to locations that is the connection devices in association with the location from the device and the like. An output from interpretation of the social map may be used by the server  **202**  to respond to a device in response to a search request for knowing proximity devices with like-mindedness.

In an example, the social map may be used for adverse event analysis (when devices misbehave), exception reporting (when devices need to report exceptions), utilization analysis (to determine which devices have been used so that they can be charged/reimbursed for), and similar reporting activities without limitations.

FIG. 14, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 13, illustrates a method flowchart for facilitating sequential, synchronous and automatically coordinated operation of the plurality of devices  **108**  through interactive elements involving a chain of tasks and devices  **108**. At step  **1402** , the method comprises providing the social networking service by the social networking server  **202**  to the plurality of devices  **108**  so that each of the plurality of devices  **108**  are connected to the social networking server  **202**  by associating respective social profiles with the social networking server  **202**. The respective social profiles are social representations of the devices  **108**  and the social networking server  **202**  is programmed to allow the devices  **108**  to coordinate for a synchronous social times-based functioning. At step  **1404** , the method comprises associating connection type social device relationships between a first device  **108**  a and a second device  **108**  b of the plurality of devices  **108**. The connection type social device relationships allow the first and second devices  **108**  a and  **108**  b to view each other's social profiles through a device user interface enabled by the server  **202**. At step  **1406** , the method further comprises receiving social content from the first device  **108**  a that is indicative of a social action performed by the first device  **108**  a and an instruction to the second device  **108**  b to perform an action in association with action timelines. The action timelines are indicative of time points associated with the action and define time when actual action should occur at the device  **108**  b. At step  **1408** , the method comprises notifying the second device  **108**  b of the social content received from the first device  **108**  a. The social content includes the instruction to the second device  **108**  b to perform the action in association with the action timelines.

The method may further include generating the social map indicative of devices and profile relationships among the devices  **108**. The method may further include storing the social map by the social networking server  **202**  so as to retrieve information from the social map to generate social proximity data, social status data, and use the social proximity and social status data to define precedence for the chain of tasks associated with the devices  **108**  for synchronous and coordinated functioning through the social networking platform  **106**. For example, based on the information extracted from the social map, the server  **202**  may be programmed to identify which devices are proximately located and which devices are remotely located relatively and also associate this information with location of a patient, capability of devices such as remotely accessible or not, patient requirement such as emergency or delayed service needed by the patient, and the like and accordingly decide the order or sequence of various tasks to complete a patient treatment procedure involving the several devices.

FIG. 15, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 14, shows the first device  **108**  a, the second device  **108**  b, the third device  **108**  c, and the fourth device  **108**  d which perform the first task  **1002** - **1** , second task  **1002** - **2** , third task  **1002** - **3** , and the fourth task  **1002** - **4**  respectively. The devices  **108**  are identified through their respective social profiles as shown in the figure. The interactive chain of elements includes the social profiles, tasks  **1002** , and devices  **108**  as shown in the figure.

The social networking server  **202**  provides a social networking health service to the plurality of devices  **108**  so that each of the plurality of devices  **108**  are connected to the social networking health service by associating the respective social profiles with the social networking server  **202**. The respective social profiles are social representation of the devices  **108**. The social profiles include various profiles as discussed earlier. In addition, the social profile discussed herein also includes a social health profile and a specification profile. The social health profile is indicative of health disciplines and instantaneous health characteristics of a device  **108**  a which are updated in real time. The specification profile is indicative of health standards which are defined for specific devices based on information contained in other profiles such as installation profile, operation profile, manufacturing profile and the like. The specification profile identifies guidelines, manuals and standard operating characteristics of the device  **108**  a. While the specification profile represents standard procedures and characteristics of the device  **108**  a, the health profile represents current characteristics of the device  **108**  a which may or may not be similar to the specification profile.

The social networking server  **202**  provides the social networking-based health service to the plurality of devices  **108**  and allows them to perform the series of social health tasks by exchange of social content in the socially aware network  **104**. The social networking server  **202**  is programmed to create and manage the individual centric profiles of the devices  **108**  that are social representation of the individual devices  **108**  within the socially aware network  **104**. The devices  **108**  are identifiable by other devices and the social networking server  **202**  through their social profiles. The social profiles of each device includes the health profile indicative of health disciplines corresponding to the device  **108**  a and specification profile that includes details corresponding to predefined working parameters of the device  **108**  a. The server  **202**  is further programmed to associate device social relationships in the socially aware network  **104**. Several types of relationships may exist based on various device characteristics and parameters which have been discussed earlier. In some examples for the various embodiments herein, the relationships may include connection relationships, wherein the connection relationships are indicative of the type of association between two or more devices in the network  **104**. The association may identify whether the two or more devices are mutual connections or not. The server  **202**  is programmed to receive updates pertaining to health profile and specification profile of a device such as  **108**  a through a social activity involving social content exchange between the device  **108**  a and the server  **202**. The updates may be received when there is any change in the health or specification parameters of the device  **108**  a. In some examples, the device  **108**  a may be provided to be used for a limited number of times or may be required to be disposed after merely a single use. In such cases, the specification parameters changes and the specification profile is updated after every use to indicate the current specification of the device  **108**  a. The health parameters may not always remain the same. For example, the health parameters may not remain the same for a long time and the performance of the device  **108**  a that is indicative of health status may change over time. This results in a change in the health profile of the device  **108**  a. As long as the health profile conforms to the requirements as defined by the specification profile, the device  **108**  a may be considered healthy. On the contrary, if the health profile is indicative of health disciplines deviating from the specifications as mentioned in the specification profile, the device  **108**  a may be considered as faulty. The server  **202**  may be programmed to associate a relationship between the specification profile of the device  **108**  a and its health profile, wherein a mismatch between one or more parameters of the health profile and the specification profile represents a fault in the device  **108**  a. The server  **202**  may further be programmed to identify a connection device to alternatively perform a function of the faulty device such that the connection device is in an idle state for a time period during which the connection device is required to alternatively perform the function.

The social networking server  **202**  further comprises the social networking application  **208**  including a cluster of social applications each for providing a specific health facility to contribute health related social activity among the devices through the socially aware network  **104**. In an example, at least one of the plurality of devices is incapable of computation capabilities at least partially. The device  **108**  a may be connected with an external controller such as  **602**  a through the Near Field Communication (NFC) channel  **604**  so that the communication point  **606**  a of the NFC channel  **604**  receives the social content from the device  **108**  a and transfers the social content to the external controller  **602**  a. The socially aware network  **104**  then allows health information sharing between the external controller  **602**  a and the social networking server  **202**  in real-time.

The device  **108**  a is coupled to an intelligent health monitoring unit  **1502**  for monitoring health profile or specification profile updates. The device  **108**  a is communicatively coupled to the database  **1108**  for storing the health profile and the specification profile and information pertinent to various updates corresponding to the specification profile and the health profile. The health profile and the specification profile and the updates are shared by the health monitoring unit  **1502**  through the social activity involving social content exchange between the health monitoring unit  **1502**  and the social networking server  **202**. The monitoring unit  **1502**  is further coupled to a health processing unit  **1504**  for processing the health profile and the specification profile information to identify if the device  **108**  a is faulty or not.

The health monitoring unit  **1502**  is integrally included within each of the plurality of devices  **108**  so that the devices  **108**  are capable of detecting a fault by comparing respective health and the specification profiles themselves with the use of the processing unit  **1504**. The social activity from the devices  **108**  involves a request to a set of connection devices to alternatively contribute in performing a function healthily when the connection devices are in idle state and when the device is faulty. The social activity can involve sending out a connection invitation to the social networking server  **202**  for identification and searching of specific devices profiles. The social networking server  **202**  is coupled to a search interface implementing a search algorithm for identifying and short listing the defined profiles. The shortlisted profiles are submitted to the device  **108**  a so that the device  **108**  a further performs a second social activity to send out connection requests to each of the shortlisted devices for extending the social network  **104**. By performing the second social activity the device  **108**  a may for example request its connection device to perform a task on its behalf for a time the device  **108**  a is in faulty state.

In some embodiments, the device  **108**  a uses a second device  **108**  b from among the shortlisted profiles as a health monitoring unit  **1502**  based on proximity and similarity in operation of the second device  **108**  b with respect to the device  **108**  a so that in case of a fault with or failure of the device  **108**  a, the second device  **108**  b performs functions of the device  **108**  a voluntarily or upon a social activity initiated by the device  **108**  a and directed to the second device  **108**  b. The second device  **108**  b may employ sensing units for monitoring environment of the first device  **108**  a so as to ensure proper functioning of the first device  **108**  a failing which the second device  **108**  b may responsibly begin tasks performed by the first device  **108**  a as a patient treatment procedure.

FIG. 17, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 16, illustrates another embodiment of an ecosystem of the devices  **108**  and respective tasks and social profiles interconnected through the social platform  **106**  implemented by the social networking server  **202**  for the purpose of health management of the devices  **108**. The ecosystem includes four additional devices—device  **108**  _e_, device,  **108**  _f_, device  **108**  _g_, and device  **108**  _h _to perform task  **1002** - **5** , task  **1002** - **6** , task  **1002** - **1** , and task  **1002** - **8**  respectively and with associated social profiles as shown. The device  **108**  _e _is associated with a social profile  **5** , device  **6**  is associated with a social profile  **6** , device  **7**  is associated with a social profile  **7** , and the device  **8**  is associated with a social profile  **8**.

The devices  **108**  a,  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d and the respective tasks form part of a first chain of tasks and devices sequenced to perform a first treatment procedure for a first patient in a defined structured and sequenced manner. The device  **108**  _e_,  **108**  _f_,  **108**  _g_, and  **108**  _h _and the respective tasks form part of a second chain of tasks and devices sequenced to perform a second treatment procedure for a second patient in a defined structured and sequenced manner. However, based on mutual relationships and connections, the devices  **108**  in the first chain and the second chain may interact through a social activity facilitated by the programmed server  **202**.

In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 18, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 17, the devices  **108**  b and  **108**  _g _are mutual connections. As a result, the devices  **108**  b and  **108**  _g _can mutually share social content by initiating a social activity through the server  **202**. For example, the device  **108**  b may request the device  **108**  _g _to perform task  **1002** - **2**  in case the device  **108**  b is faulty as the device  **108**  _g _is capable to perform the task  **1002** - **2**  which the device  **108**  b is required to perform in the treatment procedure for the first patient. Consequently, the chain of tasks and devices alters once the device  **108**  _g _accepts the request of the device  **108**  b and confirms to perform the task  **1002** - **2**. As shown, the treatment procedure now involves different devices bypassing the faulty device  **108**  b. The new chain of task and devices for the treatment procedure for the first patient are device  **108**  a and task  **1002** - **1** , device  **108**  _g _and task  **1002** - **2** , device  **108**  c and task  **1002** - **3** , and finally device  **108**  d and task  **1002** - **4**. On the other hand, the second chain of devices and tasks for the treatment procedure of the second patient involves the devices  **1008**  _e _and task  **1002** - **5** , device  **108**  _f _and task  **1002** - **6** , device  **108**  _h _and task  **1002** - **8**  with no involvement of the device  **108**  _g_. This may be possible only when the device  **108**  _g _and task  **1002** - **2**  are not required in the second chain of devices and tasks at least for the time the first chain bypasses the device  **108**  b or the treatment procedure  **1**  is more critical than and holds priority over the second treatment procedure. Therefore, prior to cross-interconnecting between different chains, the device  **108**  b determine whether the device  **108**  _g _is in idle state for the time the device  **108**  b is bypassed or may request a non-device coordinator to intervene for deciding a priority chain and priority treatment procedure and accordingly switch the device to the first chain or let it continue to perform the task  **2**  in the second chain of the devices for delivering the second treatment procedure.

FIG. 19, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 18, illustrates a method flowchart for health management of the device  **108**  a interconnected with a plurality of devices  **108**  through the social networking server  **202**. The method comprises, at step  **1902** , creating and managing individual centric profiles of the devices  **108**  that are social representation of the individual devices  **108**  within the socially aware network  **104**. The devices  **108**  are identifiable by other devices and the social networking server  **202**  through their social profiles. The social profiles of each device such as  **108**  a includes a health profile indicative of health disciplines corresponding to the device  **108**  a and specification profile that includes details corresponding to predefined working parameters of the device  **108**  a. At step  **1904** , the method further comprises associating device social relationships in the socially aware network  **104**. At step  **1906** , the method comprises receiving updates pertaining to health profile and specification profile of the device  **108**  a through a social activity involving social content exchange between the first device  **108**  a and the server  **202**. At step  **1908** , the method comprises associating a relationship between the specification profile of the device  **108**  a and its health profile. A mismatch between one or more parameters of the health profile and the specification profile represents a fault in the device  **108**  a. At step  **1910** , the method comprises identifying a connection device to alternatively perform a function of the faulty device such that the connection device is in idle state for a time period during which the connection device is required to alternatively perform the function.

In some examples, the method may also include informing the device  **108**  a about the connection device that can perform the function in case of faults with the device  **108**  a, wherein the information includes a social profile of the connection device. The method may include sending out a request by the device  **108**  a to the connection device for alternatively performing the faulty function of the device  **108**  a. The method may also include sending out a remote message by the device  **108**  a to the connection device through a social activity initiated by the device  **108**  a, wherein the remote message automatically triggers the connection device to perform the alternative function at a specified social event timeline occurrence. The method may include sending out an auto-correction message to the device  **108**  a by the health monitoring device or the second device to trigger a fault management operation for rectifying the fault of device.

FIG. 20, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 19, illustrates an interconnection of the devices  **108**  a  **108**  d through a chain of tasks and devices  **108**  a  **108**  d in an embodiment herein. As shown in FIG. 20, each of the devices  **108**  a,  **108**  b,  **108**  c, and  **108**  d are connected with the social networking server  **202**  that facilitates interconnection among the connection devices  **102**  a  **102**  d. The four devices  **102**  a  **102**  d, as shown, are connection devices and subscribe with the social networking server  **202**. The server  **202**  identifies specific tasks performed by the devices  **102**  a  **102**  d during a patient treatment procedure in an example. Further, the server  **202**  identifies, from the social profiles of the devices  **102**  a  **102**  d, defined social event timeline that define specific times when tasks  **1102** - **1**  to  **1102** - **4**  are performed by each of the devices  **102**  a  **102**  d. For example, defined social event timeline  **1**  defines that the device  **108**  a should perform the task  **1102** - **1**  at the timeline  **1**. Similarly, the second device  **108**  b performs the task  **1102** - **2**  at the social event timeline  **2**. The third device  **108**  c performs the task  **1102** - **3**  at the social event timeline  **3**  and the device  **108**  d performs the task  **1102** - **4**  at the social event timeline  **4**.

In practice, however, all the tasks  **1102** - **1102** - **4**  may not occur at the defined timelines. For example, actual time of performance of the task  **1102** - **2**  is event occurrence time  **1** , actual time of performance of task  **1102** - **2**  is event occurrence time  **2** , actual time of performance of task  **1102** - **3**  is event occurrence time  **3** , and actual time of performance of task  **1102** - **4**  is actual event occurrence time  **4**. The actual event occurrence times may or may not match the defined social timelines. In case, there is any difference between the actual event occurrence times and defined social timelines beyond a threshold, a fault may be identified and accordingly the devices  **108**  a  **108**  d may communicate one another through the social networking server  **202**. The devices  **108**  a  **108**  d may also loop in alternative devices for performance of the faulty tasks by requesting the social networking server  **202**  for identifying social connections who may perform the faulty tasks.

FIG. 21, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 20, illustrates a system  **2102**  coupled communicatively to or included in a device such as the device  **108**  a for allowing the device  **108**  a to communicate with the social networking server  **202**. The system  **2102**  facilitates monitoring and conveying of health related information from the first device  **108**  a to a second device such as the device  **108**  b interconnected through the socially aware network  **104**  and the server  **202**.

The system  **2102**  includes a processing unit/circuit  **2104** , a social event timeline recorder  **2106** , social event timeline monitoring unit  **2108** , fault detector  **2110** , and a communication circuit  **2112**. The social event timeline recorder  **2106**  stores information pertinent to when an event should occur at the first device  **108**  a, wherein the event should occur at the defined social timeline  **1**. The social event timeline monitoring unit  **2108**  monitors event occurrence time for the social event. The fault detector compares the social event timeline with the event occurrence time for the event. A gap between the social event timeline and the event occurrence time beyond a threshold limit is indicative of a fault. The events at the first device  **108**  a and at the second device  **108**  b are interdependent. The communication circuit  **2112**  allows sharing of a social content, indicative of the fault and a predicted modified event occurrence time at the first device  **108**  a, to the social networking server  **202**  through a two-way communication channel including the near field communication channel  **602**  a and the socially aware network channel  **104**. The social networking server  **202**  sends the social content to the second device  **108**  b. The first device  **108**  a and the second device  **108**  b are connections and parts of same chain of integrated tasks. The processing unit  **2104**  may process output from the social event timeline recorder  **2106** , social event timeline monitoring unit  **2108**  and fault detector  **2110**  and generate a signal indicative of the predicted modified event occurrence time. The defined social timelines of other devices may accordingly be calculated and updated based on updates in the occurrence times of the event at the device  **108**  a. In an embodiment, the processing unit  **2104** , social event timeline recorder  **2106** , social event timeline monitoring unit  **2108** , and the fault detector  **2110**  may be integrated within the health processing unit  **1504**  and health monitoring unit  **1502**  of FIG. 15 for purposes of health management of the devices  **108**  with the use of the social networking server  **202**  and the social networking platform  **106**.

The embodiments herein also provide a method for monitoring and conveying health related information from the first device  **108**  a to the second device  **108**  b interconnected through the socially aware network  **104**. The method comprises storing information related to the defined social even timelines for the task  **1102** - **1**  associated with the first device  **108**  a and the social event timelines defining times when an event should occur at the first device  **108**  a. The method further comprises monitoring the social event occurrence time by the social event timeline monitoring unit  **2108**. The method further comprises detecting a fault in functioning of the first device  **108**  a by comparing the social event timeline with the event occurrence time for the event, wherein a gap between the social event timeline and the event occurrence time beyond a threshold limit is indicative of the fault. The event at the first device  **108**  a and the event at the second device  **108**  b are interdependent. The method further comprises sharing the social content, indicative of the fault and the predicted modified event occurrence time at the first device  **108**  a, to the social networking server  **202**  through the two-way communication channel. The social networking server  **202**  sends the social content to the second device  **108**  _b._

An embodiment herein provides a facility for health monitoring of the devices  **108**  by exchange of information through the networking server  **202**. An embodiment herein provides a facility for health monitoring of the devices  **108**  by exchange of information through a networking interface that is formed by deploying the social networking platform  **106**  for the devices  **108**  so that fault monitoring and management of the devices  **108**  can be done in real-time.

An embodiment herein provides a facility for creation of the devices profiles over a social networking interface to exchange information through the networking server  **202**  for their health monitoring.

An embodiment herein provides a facility for searching, identifying and presenting related information and device profiles to a second device in response to a request submitted by a first device to make the device responsible for monitoring health parameters of the related devices based on similar operation characteristics of the two devices. An embodiment herein provides the server  **202**  that is programmed to facilitate a chat room-type setting of conversation among the devices  **108**. The chat room-type setting of conversation among the devices  **108**  may be facilitated by integrating the devices  **108**  through the social networking server  **202**  for enabling the social networking service among the devices  **108** , wherein the devices  **108**  are able to exchange social content through the chat room-type setting. In an embodiment, the window provides a facility for the devices  **108**  to chat with like-minded devices in a specific group. For example, a room may be dedicated for pacemakers only so that by entering the room, a device may directly communicate with other pacemakers that are interconnected with the server and associated with the room. The server  **202**  facilitates networking and interaction by using the chat room-type setting of conversation among the devices  **108**  for information exchange.

In an embodiment, the chat room-type setting may facilitate creation of separate profiles by the devices  **108**  over the social networking platform  **106**  dedicated to the devices  **108**  for allowing them to associate with a particular room and communicate through the chat room-type setting of conversation among the devices  **108**  within the room. The profiles are used as identifiers and gateways for the specific chat rooms. In an embodiment, health related information of the devices  **108**  may be communicated by exchange of information through the networking service among the devices  **108**  using the chat room-type setting of conversation and accordingly preventing damages associated with potential faults due to erroneous working of the devices  **108**. For example, the devices  **108**  can receive notifications pertinent to faults through the chat room setting and automatically triggering another alternative device configured to do the same function in the same room for managing device tasks alternatively. In an example, the chat room setting may automatically trigger an alternative device by sending a notification that include programs to initiate a request for switching on functioning of the alternative device in association with the profile of the faulty device and patient associated with the faulty device. In an embodiment, the server  **202**  configures the chat room-type setting of conversation among related devices bearing related devices-based profiles based on searching, identifying and retrieving related information and devices profiles in response to a request submitted by the device.

In an example, the server  **202**  is programmed to generate the social map/graph depiction for structuring and analysis of the devices  **108**  and edges (indicating relationship). In an example, the server  **202**  is programmed for social map/graph depiction for structuring and analysis of the devices  **108**  and edges (indicating relationship) that are integrated through the social networking server  **202**. An embodiment herein, in an example, facilitates automation in the devices networking and interaction by using an analytical framework of the social map/graph depiction for structuring and analysis of the devices  **108**  and edges (indicating relationship) that are integrated through the social networking server  **202**. The server  **202**  allows updating of the social map/graph depiction for structuring and analysis of the devices  **108**  and edges (indicating relationship) based on information searched and identified for related devices presented in response to a request submitted by the device such as  **108**  a. The updated graph may depict added relationships.

In an example, the server  **202**  is programmed to create and update the social profiles of the devices  **108**  automatically based on information collected from the social map/graph for structuring and analysis of the devices  **108**  and edges (indicating relationships). In an example, an embodiment herein facilitates health monitoring of the devices  **108**  and controlling faults in operational performances by forecasting faults and scheduling alternative operations using alternative devices as identified based on the social map/graph used for structuring and analysis of devices  **108**  and edges (indicating relationships). The alternative devices may be identified for example based on proximity information from the social map, and the like.

In an example, the server  **202**  is programmed for algorithm based classification and search of trending activities and computation of weight associated with each activity/post for trending rate. For example, the server  **202**  may identify trending social activities by monitoring the devices social posts and social content exchange and accordingly may tag certain activities that are trending at a particular point of time and are most frequently performed by the devices  **108**. The server  **202**  may associate a weight to an activity that defines its trending rate. For example, an exchange of social content between a heart beat monitor and a ventilator to request initiation of ventilation process for a patient may be too frequent in a particular medical environment which may be indicative that the ventilators are in high demand. Therefore, the computed weights that define trending rate may allow medical professionals to mange and deploy the devices  **108**  accordingly based on the social activities trending rate. In an example, the algorithm-based classification and search of trending activities and computation of weight associated with each activity/post for the trending rate by analyzing information and posts exchanged among the devices  **108**  is performed for the devices  **108**  that are integrated through the social networking server  **202**  over the social network  **104**. This allows automation in the devices networking and interaction by using the information obtained from algorithm based classification and search of trending activities that occur among the devices  **108**. In an example, the algorithm-based classification and search of trending activities and computation of weights associated with each activity/post for the trending rate is performed by using the information exchanged by the devices  **108**  through the chat room-type setting of conversation among the devices  **108**. In an example, the server  **202**  may facilitate algorithm-based classification and search of trending activities and searching, identifying and presenting information and device profiles to a device such as  **108**  a in response to a request submitted by the device  **108**  a so that the related device exhibits trending behavior. The embodiments herein allow computation and searching for trending profiles and accordingly presenting trending profiles to the device  **108**  a for extending network. The trending profiles in an example may be the profiles of the devices  **108**  that show or perform trending activities or exchange trending social content. In an example, the trending behavior of a device such as  **108**  a may represent a behavior which involves communicating with trending devices and exchange trending social content. This may allow facilitating actions performed by the devices  **108**  based on what is most desired in a medical or any other environment and accordingly prioritizing the devices networking and tasks. In an embodiment, the prioritization and the trending behavior may be controlled by human coordinators so as to allow the interconnected network to function in the most optimal manner and utilize the devices  **108**  and tasks and interconnections in the most efficient manner. In an example, the server  **202**  may be programmed to create the devices profiles and associate profiles-based trending activities by using an algorithm-based classification and search of trending activities for identifying devices behavior in association with profiles types for facilitating network extension toward profiles with a surge of trending activities.

In an example, an embodiment herein facilitates health monitoring of the devices by exchange of information through the social networking server  **202**  and identifying trending health problems among the devices  **108**  by using the algorithm-based classification and search of trending activities related to health status and by computation of weights associated with each post/activity for trending rate so as to develop fault management and health plans for the devices  **108**  in a critical medical environment for the most dangerous and most trending faults, wherein the trending faults are identified based on the trending information pertinent to social content that is indicative of faults during health information exchange.

In an example, the server  **202**  is programmed to facilitate searching, identifying and presenting related information and device profiles to a device such as  **108**  a in response to a request submitted by the device  **108**  a. The searching, identifying, and presenting of the related information and device profiles to the device  **108**  a in response to the request submitted by the device  **108**  a is performed in an environment that includes a plurality of integrated devices  **108**  that are interconnected through the social networking server  **202**. In an example, the server  **202**  may be programmed for submitting invitations to a related device upon receiving related information and device profiles for extending social network among the integrated devices  **108**. In an example, the server  **202**  may be programmed for searching, identifying and presenting related information and device profiles to a device such as  **108**  a in response to a request submitted by the device  **108**  a for automating devices networking and interaction. In an example, the server  **202**  may be programmed for creation of the devices profiles and allowing searching, identifying and presenting related information and device profiles to the device  **108**  a in response to the request submitted by the device  **108**  _a._

In an example, an embodiment herein provides a server  **202**  that is programmed for facilitating sequential, synchronous and automated operation of several integrated devices  **108**  via interactive elements through a chain of tasks and devices  **108**. In an example, an embodiment herein provides a server  **202**  that is preprogrammed for sequential, synchronous and automated operation of the several devices  **108**  via interactive elements through the chain of tasks and devices  **108**  that are integrated through the social network  **104**. The server  **202**  facilitates healthcare automation among the plurality of medical devices  **108**  by using the sequential, synchronous and automated operation of the several integrated devices  **108**  via the interactive elements through the chain of tasks and devices  **108**. In an example, the server  **202**  allows creation of devices profiles over the social networking server  **202**  and facilitate sequential, synchronous and automated operation of the several integrated devices  **108**  via the interactive elements by associating the profiles to the operating devices  **108**  and controlling operations based on respective profiles of the devices  **108** , wherein the profiles can be a manufacturing profile, an installation profile or an operation profile of a device such as  **108**  a or any other type of profile as discussed earlier. The server  **202**  allows health monitoring of the integrated devices  **108** , exhibiting a sequential, synchronous and automated operation via the interactive elements through the chain of tasks and devices  **108** , by exchange of information through the networking server  **202**.

The server  **202**  is programmed to provide an analytical framework for sequential, synchronous and automated operation of the several integrated devices  **108**  via the interactive elements through the chain of tasks and devices  **108**  by employing the social map/graph depiction for structuring and analysis of the devices  **108**  and edges (indicating relationship).

The server  **202**  is programmed to perform searching, identifying and receiving related information and profiles of an adjacent device in a sequential, synchronous and automated operation in response to a request submitted by a device such as  **108**  a for automatically coordinating the sequential tasks synchronously. In an example, social networking timelines are associated with events defining times when particular events occur at the devices  **108**. The social networking timelines associated with events defining times when particular events occurred at the devices  **108**  are recorded so as to integrate the devices  **108**  for events occurrences at regular recorded times through the social networking server  **202**. The server  **202**  facilitates automated networking and devices interaction by automatically triggering devices events based on determined social networking timelines associated with the events defining times when particular events should occur at the devices  **108**.

In an example, the server  **202**  is programmed to define profiles of the devices  **108**  so that the profiles include social networking timelines associated with events defining times particular events should occur at the devices  **108** , such that the profiles govern occurrences of events. The devices  **108**  that have adjacent occurrences of events may be classified in groups. An embodiment herein provides an automated tool for identifying social networking timelines associated with events defining times when particular events should occur at the devices  **108**  by analytically utilizing social map/graph depiction for structuring and analysis of the devices  **108**  and relationships with the use of analytical computation models, wherein each of the dimensions along edges are indicative of respective timelines between corresponding events occurring at respective devices  **108**  that form nodes connecting the edges.

In an example, an embodiment herein facilitates in defining social networking timelines associated with the events that define times when particular events occur at the devices  **108**  in a sequential, synchronous, and automated operation of several integrated devices  **108**  via interactive elements through a chain of tasks and devices  **108**  so as to synchronously manage the tasks precedence based on the defined social timelines. In an example, an embodiment herein facilitates healthy operation of sequential, synchronous and automated integrated devices  **108**  via interactive elements in a "chain of tasks and devices  **108**" by automatically managing objectionable interaction of the devices  **108**  thereby resulting in a trustworthy performance of the sequential and synchronous nature of the entire chain of tasks and devices  **108**. The social networking timelines are associated with events defining times when particular objectionable events occurred at devices and accordingly the server facilitates in preventing an impact of the objectionable events at other scheduled timelines by monitoring when would the affect of the objectionable event reach to other nodes or devices that share a timelines gap with the devices exhibiting the objectionable events.

In an example, an embodiment herein facilitates sequential, synchronous, and automated operation of several integrated devices  **108**  via interactive elements through a "chain of tasks and devices" by using a chat room-type setting for conversing among the devices  **108**  in real-time. A device such as  **108**  a triggers operation of an interconnected device such as  **108**  b by posting messages through the chat room setting so that the other device  **108**  b sequentially operates after receiving commands from other devices proceeding in the chain.

In an example, the server  **202**  is programmed to facilitate prioritizing tasks in a sequential, synchronous and automated operation of several integrated devices  **108**  via interactive elements through a chain of tasks and devices  **108**  based on priority ratings of the devices  **108**  as decided analytically through an algorithm-based classification and search system for trending activities and computation of weights associated with each activity/post for trending rate indicative of priority ratings of the sequential tasks. The priority ratings define criticality and importance of a device such as  **108**  a and respective tasks in the chain of devices  **108**  and tasks.

In an example, the server  **202**  facilitates health monitoring of the devices  **108**  by recording actual event occurrence times at a stage and comparing actual real time event occurrence times with predefined social networking timelines associated with events defining times when particular events should occur at the devices  **108**  in normal functioning, wherein a lag beyond a threshold value between the actual real time determined time values and the predefined time values is indicative of a fault and abnormal health. In an example, the social networking server  **202**  facilitates updating of the defined social networking timelines associated with events defining times when particular events should occur at the devices  **108**  in real time by exchange of information through a chat room-type setting of conversation among the devices  **108**  implemented through the social networking platform  **106**  for the devices  **108**. The updating of the timelines is needed for several reasons including in cases of malfunctioning of one or more devices and accordingly bypassing those devices or routing tasks through alternative devices capable of compensating for the malfunctioning devices.

In an example, the server  **202**  facilitates correlating devices that exhibit trending activities with social networking timelines associated with events defining times when particular events occur at corresponding devices that exhibit the trending activities for identifying 'trending times' that are indicative of times when trending activities would preferably occur so as to facilitate advanced monitoring of the trending activities based on forecasted times for occurrences of such trending activities. In an embodiment, the trending activities define critical activities performed by the devices, or important activities, or highest value activities by the devices.

In an example, the social networking server  **202**  facilitates searching, identifying, and receiving information and device profiles by a device such as  **108**  a for specific devices that correspond to specific social networking timelines associated with events defining times when particular events occur at devices so that the specific timelines of the devices match with timelines for one or more malfunctioning devices in the social network  **104**  of the devices, and subsequently identifying whether one or more of these identified devices can perform and are capable of performing activities of the malfunctioning devices so as to replace the malfunctioning devices or activities with the devices and activities so identified that also inherently bears similar timelines occurrences and so prevent any unwanted affect in their synchronous operation with other devices.

In an example, the server  **202**  is programmed to automatically manage objectionable interaction of the devices  **108**. In an example, the server  **202**  is programmed for automatically managing objectionable interaction of the devices  **108**  that are integrated through the social aware network  **104**. In an example, the server  **202**  is programmed for automatically managing objectionable interaction of the devices  **108**  in an automation environment of the devices  **108**  facilitating an automated networking and interaction among the devices  **108**  using the social networking server  **202**. In an example, the server  **202**  is programmed for automatically managing objectionable interaction of the devices  **108**  by updating profiles of the devices over the social networking server  **202**  so that the updated profile conforms with the requirements and is no more objectionable and also storing information pertaining to the objectionable behavior and corresponding profiles in a database maintained by the social networking server  **202**. In an example, an embodiment herein facilitates health monitoring of the devices  **108**  by exchange of information through the social networking server  **202**  and blocking objectionable interaction of the devices  **108**  in the network  **104**  that do not fulfill required health criteria thereby preventing faults and critical situations from occurring in a medical environment beforehand. The server  **202**  is programmed to assess, and update social map/graph depiction for structuring and analysis of the devices  **108**  and edges (indicating relationship) based on detection of an objectionable behavior of a device such as  **108**  a, wherein the updating may include redefining vertices and edges of the map that correspond to the devices  **108**  and various relationships among the devices  **108**.

In an example, the server  **202**  may be programmed to facilitate detection of an objectionable behavior of a device such as  **108**  a by another device such as  **108**  b and communicate information about the behavior to a social networking service manager or server  **202**  through a chat room-type setting in real-time so as to manage the objectionable behavior in real-time. In an embodiment, adjacent devices that are directly connected with a device such as  **108**  a may detect the objectionable behavior the earliest and may communicate the information to the service manager or/and to other devices  **108**  that may be directly or critically affected by the objectionable behavior.

In an example, the server  **202**  is programmed for performing algorithm-based classification and searching of trends of objectionable behavior and objectionable interaction of the devices  **108**  and accordingly creating a fault management plan in advance. The plan may be used for prioritizing safety of those devices that exhibit trending activities, and for ensuring that monitoring of the objectionable behavior is based on the determined trending objectionable behavior. The objectionable behavior may be indicated in the form of an activity initiated either by the device exhibiting the objectionable behavior or by another integrated device that is influenced by the objectionable behavior of the other device. The activity that is indicative of the objectionable behavior is termed as 'objection identification activity'.

In an example, the server  **202**  is programmed for searching, identifying, and receiving related information and device profiles that show a typical defined objectionable behavior with other related devices for defined time duration in response to a request submitted by the device  **108**  a. In an example, the server  **202**  facilitates searching, identifying, and receiving related information and device profiles that have not shown any objectionable behavior with other related devices for defined time duration in response to a request submitted by a device such as  **108**  a. The time duration defined behavior that is free from any objection is indicative of a reliability and trustworthiness of a device so that the device can be used as an alternative in an environment of a plurality of devices  **108**  for efficient and reliable performance especially during a critical medical task or operation.

In accordance with some embodiments, the SNP  **106**  can be implemented with the use of various social application programming interfaces (APIs). In some embodiments, various statistical tools and protocols can be employed in the development of the SNP  **106**  so as to enable various statistical and analytical capabilities within the SNP  **106**.

In an embodiment, various medical devices or other devices  **108**  can be integrated through the social networking platform  **106**. The integrated devices  **108**  can share or exchange information, announce them publicly, represent themselves through their social profiles and can perform several other functions.

In an embodiment, the devices  **108**  can operate in the SNP network  **104**  with the use of limited manual intervention such as in case of a semi-automated architecture. The settings can be defined accordingly so as to define the nature and extent of automation.

In an embodiment, the devices  **108**  can operate over the SNP  **106**  in a completely automated fashion, wherein the devices  **108**  can be deployed with sensors, detectors, and other monitoring and regulating devices that may be capable of monitoring the performance of the devices  **108**  as and when needed or in real time. In an example embodiment, the sensors, detectors, and monitoring devices can be configured to be current based, pressure based, chemical composition based, location based, vibration based, light based, motion based, temperature based, physiological signal based, acoustic signal based, sound based, chemical compound or biomolecules interaction based, infrared sensor, electric current based, electric potential based, magnetic or radio based, environment based, weather based, moisture based, humidity based, flow based, fluid velocity based, ionizing radiation based, atomic particles detection based, navigation instruments, location based, position based, angle based, displacement based, distance based, speed based, and acceleration based, imaging based, photon based, and optic based, force based, density based, level based, thermal or heat based, proximity based, and presence based, and various other types of sensors and detectors based on various detection and sensing technologies. In addition, various other technologies such as RFID, bar code detection and the like can also be employed to enable a completely automated architecture of the SNP  **104**  for the devices interaction and integration.

In an embodiment, the devices  **108**  are capable of creating their profiles over the SNP  **106**. The profiles can be created automatically based on the information collected from the devices  **108**  or semi-automatically based on instructions from the devices  **108**  or manually based on instructions from an associated person that triggers the devices  **108**  to connect with the SNP  **106**  and create profiles. In an embodiment, the profiles can be created by uploading manuals and device related documents in a specific portal assigned to a device so that the server  **202**  can execute instructions based on a set of executable device-based custom templates to create custom profiles for specific types of devices.

In an embodiment, the SNP  **106**  can facilitate health monitoring of the integrated devices  **108**  over the SNP  **106**. For example, the member devices  **108**  of the SNP  **106**  can automatically share and update their performance related information on their profiles which can be regularly monitored by the server  **202**  or by a person associated with the devices  **108**. This may enable reporting of health related information of the devices  **108**  to respective entity such as a responsible person. Alternatively, a responsible person may also visit the profiles of respective devices over the SNP  **106**  and identify health breaks, if any, and can accordingly take steps.

In an embodiment, several devices  **108**  can further be facilitated with the use of a chat room type of window that can be visible on the website of the SNP  **106**. The devices  **108**  can read messages shared from their connections and also share information with them or respond to them through the same window. As discussed above, this interaction may also be partially automated, completely automated, or manually intervened and can employ technologies such as those discussed above.

In an embodiment, the relationships of the devices  **108**  may be represented with the use of the social graph as discussed earlier. The nodes may represent a complete web of the relationship and may be read and analyzed and interpreted manually by an external person associated with the devices  **108**  or by the devices  **108**  automatically. In some cases, special software and algorithms may be deployed to interpret the social map. The social map may assist the devices  **108**  to expand their connections, manage their connections, manage the information sources, and perform several other tasks.

In an embodiment, the devices  **108**  may exchange information among them and also search for tending topics and other posts on the SNP  **106**  posted by other devices  **108**. For example, each of the posts in the SNP  **106**  made by the devices  **108**  can be associated with a rating or relevancy factor based on one or more parameters. In particular, one important factor for identifying activities of the devices or posts posted from the devices is the determination of related posts that are most relevant to the activity of a device seeking for relevant activities and posts. Other parameters may include such things as the nature of the devices  **108** , geographic proximity, like-mindedness, social map or graph proximity along such as the edges as discussed above. Various mathematical and statistical tools may be implemented to identify the proximity along the edges in the social map with the use of software and hardware combinations. Other parameters may include such things as trendiness based on a universal rating such as provided by the SNP  **106**  or based on public viewing of the activity or the post by the devices  **108**. In an embodiment, the social networking platform  **106**  may present related posts to a device  **108**  a such as, for example, a post determined to be a trending topic or a post to a device  **108**  a that is in the geographic proximity. In other embodiments, a device  **108**  a may configure one or more settings or parameters to dictate when the social networking platform  **106**  should present related posts to the device  **108**  a. In some cases, weights may be associated to the activities and posts and relevance of the activity or post may be determined based on the computed weights.

In an embodiment, a device  **108**  a can query a database of profiles of the devices  **108**  such as of a community of the devices  **108**. The query can include such things as information pertinent to a device  **108**  a such as including, without limitations, the name of the device  **108**  a, identifier of the device  **108**  a, type of the device  **108**  a, medical conditions treated by the device  **108**  a, therapies delivered by the device  **108**  a, patient identifier associated with the device  **108**  a, life style factors associated with a patient associated with the device  **108**  a, environmental factors, contextual factors, historical records stored in the device  **108**  a, and so on. Upon searching, the device  **108**  a can view the matching profiles, connect with them, post message for them, like or dislike their posts, use their data upon request, share information with them, and perform further queries or refine the queries.

In an embodiment, the devices  **108**  that operate in a sequence can connect together on the SNP  **106**. The connected devices  **108**  can be programmed to operate according to decided and programmed settings in a sequence. Any information relevant from a previous stage by a device  **108**  a in a next stage or in the same stage by any other device  **108**  b may be shared through the SNP  **108**  which may be accessed by other devices  **108**  in the same or subsequent stages accordingly. Thus, several devices  **108**  that operate integrated can further be integrated through the SNP  **106**  and information sharing can happen in real time. Further, the data generated through integration of the devices  **108**  may be used to facilitate an integrated and multi-staged operation of other devices in a different location. The integrated operation of the devices  **108**  in such a manner with the use of the SNP  **106**  can for example be implemented in a connected dosing or diagnostic center or even in an assembly line of a manufacturing system without any limitations. Sensors and monitoring devices may be integrated in the devices  **108**  so as to collect relevant information from the devices  **108**. The stages and the status of the stages in which the devices  **108**  currently operate may be identified with the use of these and other such identification and sensing technologies.

In an embodiment, the SNP  **108**  can implement social networking timelines associated with events defining times when particular events occur in relation to the devices  **108**. This implementation approach can be integrated in architecture of several devices  **108**  integrated through the SNP  **106**  and working in any of a sequential, synchronous, and automated operation. For example, the timelines associated with occurrence of an event at a device  **108**  a may govern the occurrence of another event at another device  **108**  b. This may be controlled by tagging the devices  **108**  for particular events and then monitoring for the occurrence of the events and communicating to the connected devices  **108**  through the SNP  **106**. The timelines can be depicted with the use of a line or a scatter graph, for example, and visible over a display for use by a patient or a hospital or a physician or any other entity.

In an embodiment, the SNP  **106**  can manage objectionable behavior. For example, the SNP  **106**  can automatically manage objectionable interaction of the devices  **108**  such as from those that may not be required in a particular set of operations relevant in synchronous and coordinated functioning of a particular set of devices. Similarly, various other types of objectionable behavior may be defined based on one or more parameters. The server  **202**  may be deployed that is communicatively coupled to the SNP  **106**. The server  **202**  may monitor activities of the devices  **108**  and decide whether a predefined rule or policy is violated. A database (not shown) may manage the predefined rules and the policies. The policy may have different levels of violation.

In accordance with some embodiments, the devices  **108**  that are associated with the social networking platform  **106**  follows a Unique Device Identification (UDI) system. The UDI may require the devices  **108**  to bear a unique identifier that identifies that device or components thereof through manufacturing, distribution, use, and social networking phases. The UDI may allow the devices, for example, to include information in the form of a label. In an embodiment, the information may be contained in the social profiles of the devices  **108**  as a component of several sub-profiles. In an example, the social profile may include a sub-profile of UDI social profile managed and implemented by an application sub-component of UDI application component. In an example, the manufacturing social profile may include information in the form of an identifier that identifies the device such as  **108**  a during a manufacturing stage, the operation social profile may include the information for identification of the device  **108**  a during operation or distribution or use phases, and the like. In some embodiments, the UDI information may vary from one phase to another phase such as may vary during manufacturing and distribution. In some embodiments, the UDI information may remain constant. In cases when the information varies, the UDI may also associate identification information with different phases so as to correlate device identification in one phase with device identification in another phase.
