### Description

**CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS**

This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/607,997 filed on Sep. 10, 2012, the complete disclosure of which, in its entirety, is hereby incorporated by reference.

### <span style="font-size:20px">BACKGROUND</span>

1. Technical Field

The embodiments herein generally relate to electronic records systems, and, more particularly, to storage, access and authorization of electronic records for access over a communication network.

1. Description of the Related Art

Generally, several types of services such as financial services, healthcare services or information services or others, and associated parameters, attributes and responses related to the services are documented by entities such as physicians, doctors, hospitals or other service providers, analysts, specialists, and others dealing in information management. At times, information holders or owners such as patients may also document their information or data. With the advent of new technologies, such types of documented information can be stored electronically which is generally referred to as electronic records.

Electronic records are user or owner specific and are generally kept as confidential by the owner of the information or the records. In modern days, these records can be deposited and secured in a central database that is connected over a networked platform such as through an internet that can be accessible by the owner easily.

In certain conditions, an external device other than the patient such as a general consumer of the information or records may be interested in the electronic records and may want to access them. However, as per the conditions prescribed by several authorities and standards such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) meant for health-related information and several others, it is imperative and important to gain authorization from an owner for accessing his electronic records. The process of authorization can be fairly simple if the records are limited. An external device or a consumer may directly approach the owner for authorization. However, as the data contained within the records increase to a large extent, the task of identifying relevant data and gaining access and authorization becomes complex and difficult.

In an embodiment, specific types of information may be defined by unique identifiers such as for example demographic information of the patient  **202**  a may be defined by a first identifier, clinical information of the patient  **202**  a may be defined by a second identifier, lab information of the patient  **202**  a may be defined by a third identifier, and medication related information may be defined by a fourth identifier. The set of rules as defined by the patients  **202**  a may be associated with specific identifiers so as to cumulatively define rules based on the nature of the information. Thus, the set of rules may vary as the nature of information varies. Similarly, the set of rules may also define payment options and payment requirements which may also be associated in conjunction with the identifiers for the specific information. Therefore, payment requirements for example for the demographic information may be different from the payment requirements of the clinical information. In an embodiment, the patient  **202**  a may also place restrictions for accessing more complicated, important and critical information such as medication related information as compared to relatively less critical information such as demographic information. Accordingly, the external device  **208**  may be required to justify its access such as by producing valid documents highlighting importance and genuineness of the access. Also, in such cases, the payment requirements may be higher relatively as defined by the set of rules in association with a respective identifier. In general, the set of rules are defined to govern access of the external device  **208**  and validate the access by the patient  **202**  _a._

The contextual authorization device  **314**  further includes an access module  **318**  that processes authorization of the external device  **208**  for access of the computerized records, at least in part.

If the authorization results in the grant of the access, the authorization code is generated which is used by the server  **204**  for allocating rights to access the medical records. On the contrary, if the access is denied, the authorization code is not generated, and the external device  **208**  is denied or blocked for access. At step  **708** , in case the authorization is made, the method  **700**  includes facilitating the external device  **208**  to access the computerized records stored in the computerized records data-store  **302**  by submitting the authorization code along with other details. Before final authorization, the external device  **208**  may be required to clear payments for the access of the computerized records, at least in part.

In an embodiment, the method  **700**  includes updating the set of rules periodically by the patient  **202**  a , and terminating the access of an already authorized access upon not meeting requirements prescribed by a new set of rules as defined by updating.

The embodiments herein may be related to a single or limited number of patients. However, it should be appreciated that a plurality or a network of the patients  **202**  (as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2) may be included in the system  **300**  such that the patients  **202**  may include the patient  **202**  a as discussed above referred to such as a first patient  **202**  a . The patients  **202**  including the first patient  **202**  a are allowed to create a marketplace for selling of the computerized records, at least in part, or for authorizing access for limited use of the computerized records, at least in part, upon being registered with the at least one computerized records data store  **302**  or the server  **204**  through the sign in scheme  **210** , as discussed above.

FIG. 8 illustrates an example of the contextual authorization device  **314**  in detail, in an embodiment of the invention. The contextual authorization device  **314**  may be configured to authorize access to the external device  **208**  for the computerized records at least in part. The contextual authorization device  **314**  includes the database  **316**  storing the custom rules digitally dictating the access rights and levels for the external device  **208**  based on static information associated with the external device  **208**  and based on dynamically changing contextual information of the external device  **208**  and its associated entity. The database  **316**  has been discussed already above.

The contextual authorization device  **314**  further includes a Global Positioning System (GPS)-based tracking device  **802**  for tracking dynamically changing geo-location of the external device  **208**. For example, at a particular time, the external device  **208**  may be situated in a hospital, at other time the external device may be situated in a pharmacy or a lab or at home. When the external device  **208**  sends a request to access the computerized records at least in part, the GPS-based tracking device  **802**  may receive the geo-location of the external device  **208**  too along with the request. The GPS-based tracking device  **802**  may regularly monitor the external device  **208**  for its location.

The custom rules may define a set of location types and associated access levels such that a few different location types may be a hospital, a nursing center, a pharmacy, home, a lab, and the like. Each of the location types may be associated with specific levels of success and specific types of computerized records accessible from a particular type of location. For example, the hospital as a location type may be indicative of allowing a complete access to computerized records, a lab as a location type may be indicative of allowing to access digital medical records that relate to tests and diagnosis reports and doctor prescriptions, a pharmacy as a location type may be indicative of allowing to access digital medical prescriptions only. When the external device  **208**  is noted to be present at home, the external device  **208**  may be allowed to access only limited information. The various location types may be identified based on the geo-location signifying the location type and accordingly inform the access module  **318**  to provide authorization of the computerized records, at least in part, based on the level of access allowed in view of the location type, if the external device meets other authorization criteria. The custom rules may define different rights for different location types as identified from the geo-location of the external device  **208**  such that the different rights may define either one of an outright denial or approval of the access or limiting the access to one or more types of digital records based on the location types, in an embodiment. The GPS-based tracking device  **802**  may generate a first signal indicative of the geo-location associated with the external device  **208**  which may be transmitted to the access module  **318**  for the access module  **318**  to determine a location type of the external device  **208** , level of access allowed accordingly and nature of computerized records allowed to be accessed by the external device  **208**.

The contextual authorization device  **314**  may further include a credentialing engine  **804**  to determine a crowdsourced credentialing score associated with an entity associated with the external device  **208**. The crowdsourced credentialing score is determined based on credentialing of a digital profile of the entity by a plurality of respondents such that the crowdsourced credentialing score is indicative of trustworthiness of the external device  **208**. The custom rules may be defined to allow authorization of the external device  **208**  only when the entity associated with the external device  **208**  possesses at least a minimum threshold score. The credentialing engine  **804**  may determine the crowdsourced credentialing score associated with the entity connected with the external device  **208**  and generate a second signal. The second signal may be transmitted to the access module  **318**  for the access module  **318**  to compare the determined crowdsourced credentialing score with the minimum threshold score and accordingly allow or reject authorization to access the computerized records, at least in part, either entirely or only limited to particular nature of the computerized records.

The information can be transformed in the form of profiles by the federated profile manager  **908**. The segmenting engine  **910**  may then use the profiles information and perform the task of segmenting of the overall profiles into the federated profiles associated with each of the entities.

The profile certification server  **904**  may be communicatively coupled to or included in the profile management server  **902**. The profile certification server  **904**  may include a certification engine  **912** , a segment rating engine  **914** , and a profile rating engine  **916**. The certification engine  **912**  may further include a segment certification engine  **918**  and a profile certification engine  **920**.

The segment certification engine  **918**  may be configured to facilitate credentialing or certification of the federated profiles associated with the profiles associated with each of the entities connected to the external system  **208**. The segment certification engine  **918**  is configured to allow a plurality of crowdsourced respondents to respond to the federated profiles associated with the profiles of the entities and credential them. The credentialing of each of the federated profiles associated with the profiles of an entity contributes to credentialing of the entire profile of the entity upon collation of the credentialed federated profiles. As more and more persons or respondents from the plurality of crowdsourced respondents verify the information in the federated profiles, the trust associated with credentialing of the respective federated profiles increases. Therefore, the crowdsourcing may allow credentialing of the federated profiles to a higher degree of accuracy and reliability. Since the discrete federated profiles associated with the entity are credentialed from the plurality of crowdsourced respondents, the credentialing defines a high level of accuracy and may be considered as highly authentic and reliable and acceptable by third parties or agencies.

The segment certification engine  **918**  is adapted to certify the stored federated profiles relating to the entities who must have their credentials verified. According to some embodiments herein, the number of sources credentialing a particular federated profile may be associated with each of the segments to indicate a level of accuracy of the credentialing information. Also, the relevant information about credentialing such as who credentialed, when credentialed may also be associated with each credentialing of each of the federated profiles so that an authenticity may be judged by associating an overall impact of the federated profiles' credentialing, number of times credentialed, and trust factor about the source who verified and relevance about the source and time when verified. Therefore, in such embodiments, a multi-scaled and cumulative score may be determined and multi-scaled and cumulative credentialing may be done based on the multi-scaled cumulative score determined.

The information pertaining to credentialing of the individual federated profiles of a profile associated with an entity may influence an overall credentialing of the profile. For example, individual credentialing of the federated segments may contribute to the overall profile credentialing such that the credentialing of the overall profile may depend on each of the federated profiles' credentialing with a weightage attached to each credentialing of the federated profiles. The collated contribution considering weightage effect of each credentialing finally decides credentialing of the overall profile. The task of credentialing the overall profile associated with an entity may be performed by the profile certification engine  **920**. For example, the profile certification engine  **920**  may facilitate credentialing of the profile in its entirety based on the collated effect of credentialing of the federated profiles associated with the profile of the entity. The profile certification engine  **920**  may receive information pertinent to credentialing of each of the federated profiles associated with the overall profile and then associate the defined weightages to each of the federated profiles and perform cumulative credentialing of the overall profile. In an embodiment, the weightages may be determined based on parameters defined by a service provider who operates the credentialing engine  **804**. In such embodiments, the weightages may be defined based on for example past experiences or current understanding about significance of accuracy of credentialing for different segments. For example, the accuracy of credentialing may be more important for work history than information pertinent to hobbies of a professional when applying for a job. Therefore, the objective use of the credentialing information may influence determination of the weightages and hence the overall credentialing. Therefore, a score indicative of the influence of the objective may be associated for the credentialing purposes in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the weightages may be defined by an agency requiring the credentialing information. Therefore, in such cases, the profile certification engine  **920**  may perform credentialing of the common profile in a custom defined manner and also in association with the objective score.

The profile certification server  **904**  further includes the segment rating engine  **914**. The segment rating engine  **914**  is configured to associate a rating to each of the credentialed federated profiles based on credentialing from the crowdsourced plurality of respondents and depending on a level of accuracy and trust associated with the credentialing of the federated profiles. The rating may depend on who credentialed a federated profile, when was a profile credentialed, how many times a profile was credentialed, how many unique credentials are done, relevance of respondents credentialing the federated profile, relationship of the respondents with the entity such as of the credentialed federated profile, and the like.

The profile certification server  **904**  may further include the profile rating engine  **916**. The profile rating engine  **916**  is configured to associate a rating to an entire profile based on credentialing of each of the federated profiles and ratings associated with each of the federated profiles as determined by the segment rating engine  **914**  cumulatively.

The profile management server  **902**  is coupled to a profiles database  **922**  to store information pertinent to the profiles of the plurality of entities. The profiles database  **922**  may be coupled to the federated profile manager  **908**  such that the federated profile manager  **908**  maintains the information stored in the profiles database  **922**.

The profile certification server  **904**  may be coupled to a profiles certification database  **924**. The profiles certification database  **924**  is configured to store information pertinent to credentialing such as certification status of the federated or overall profiles associated with the plurality of entities. For example, the certification status may include one or more of verified segment, verified profile, pending verification, verification in progress, segment rejected as incorrect, profile rejected as incorrect and the like. The profiles certification database  **924**  may be coupled to the profiles database  **922**  and the certification engine  **912**.

The profile certification server  **904**  may be coupled to a certified profiles database  **926**. The certified profiles database  **926**  may further be coupled to the profiles certification database  **924**. The certified profiles database  **926**  may be configured to store profiles that have been verified by the certification engine  **912**. An entity or agency may be allowed a direct access to the certified profiles database  **926**  based on preferences and rules defined for the entity or the agency. The entity may be one of a medical entity such as a hospital, nursing center, doctor, physician, healthcare unit, and government healthcare department, or an entity belonging to other industry such as financial sector, energy, transportation and the like or any other third-party or agency and associated with the external device  **208**. The certified profile or credential database  **926**  may further store information pertinent to one or more of work history, education, and personal demographics, affiliations to hospitals or other institutes etc. of one or more entities corresponding to one or more of verified profiles.

The profiles database  **922** , profiles certification database  **924** , and the certified profiles database  **926**  may be coupled to a profiles sources database  **928**. The profile sources database  **928**  may include information about a plurality of sources in the network  **106**  that are linked to the federated profiles associated with the plurality of the entities, and information about a plurality of sources who responds to the federated profiles for credentialing. For example, in the network  **106** , the plurality of respondents may credential the federated profiles and thus the profiles sources database  **928**  may store their details, their names, other information, their relevance and relationship with the entities associated with the federated profiles they credential and time of credentialing, and location of original credentialing or any other such information pertinent to the credentialing sources etc.

In an example, the profiles database  **922** , profiles certification database  **924** , and the certified profiles database  **926**  may be blockchain configured so as to allow access by the entities (and respondents) or any other agency and associated computing systems similar to the external device  **208**  through the distributed plurality of access points simultaneously and reflect or view reviews or any changes during review process in near real-time.

In an embodiment, the credentialing by the respondents is used to associate a rating and define a level of trust for the federated profiles and the overall profiles.

In an embodiment, an external service provider may deploy the credentialing engine  **804**  and provide credentialing scores to the server  **204**  or the contextual authorization device  **314**  as and when requested by the server  **204**  or the contextual authorization device  **314**  upon a request of access of the computerized records being submitted by the external system  **208**  or associated entity to the server  **204**. The credentialing engine  **804**  may generate the second signal indicative of the credentialing score and the trustworthiness of the external device  **208**  and its associated entity. The second signal may be processed by the access module  **318**.

Referring back to FIG. 8, the contextual authorization device  **314**  may include a user behavior analytics engine  **806**  to compare dynamically changing contextual details associated with the entity with a set of past requests indicative of historical behavior of the entity. Based on comparison of the contextual details of the entity and the associated external device  **208**  with their historical behavior, the user behavior analytics engine  **806**  may determine commonalities and mismatches in the behavior and accordingly determine an index of normality which is indicative of an extent of similarity in the contextual behavior and the historical behavior. The custom rules may be defined to allow the access only when a minimum predefined threshold of normality is noted about the external device  **208**  and the associated entity. The user behavior analytics engine  **806**  may be configured to generate a third signal indicative of the index of normality and transmit it to the access module  **318**  so that the access module  **318**  can allow authorization of the access to the external device  **208**  based on the index of normality alone or along with one or more other parameters as identified by the credentialing engine  **804**  and the GPS-based device  **802**.
