Each subject can be associated with a unique subject identifier, usually comprising of a numeric or alphanumeric sequence that is unidentifiable outside the EMR system  **108**. In examples, the subject identifier may also be referred to as a medical record number or master patient index (MPI). The unique subject identifier can link and update all digital data associated with the subject. The detailed description about association of the digital data with the subject will be described in later paragraphs of the document.

In some embodiments, the social network platform  **106** , as shown in FIG. 1, may interact with the EMR system  **108**  to implement a social cloud. The social network platform  **106**  can include one or more social network servers  **110**  and database servers  **112**  to provide real-time data updates to the EMR system  **108**. The social network servers  **110**  in communication with the database servers  **112**  may allow the subject to access and update or share the digital data either manual inputs or through automated data scraping and extraction techniques. The social network servers  **110**  may constantly interact with the EMR system  **108**  to provide real-time data updates associated with the subject (or associated entities such as care providers or healthcare providers). Likewise, the social network servers  **110**  may also provide real-time updates associated with one or more social services to the EMR system  **108**.

The EMR system  **108** , described herein, may be centralized or decentralized. In an embodiment, the EMR system  **108**  may be blockchain configured to allow a federated distributed access for the entities. The EMR system  **108**  may store the digital data related to the subjects in a digital records repository  **114**. The EMR system  **108**  may communicate with different servers and repositories such as the social network servers  **110**  and the database servers  **112** , and the private networks  **102**. The digital records repository  **114**  can store the plurality of electronic healthcare records (or the digital data referred interchangeably) including data or information related to the entities in the form of computer executable files associated with the subject containing the digital data. The digital data can be organized in such a way that facilitates local or remote information access and manipulation in the communication network  **104**  via a processing component  **120**. In some embodiments, the processing component  **120**  may be, but not limited to, a microprocessor, a microcontroller, or equivalent. The processing component  **120**  may be capable of executing instructions to process the digital data over the communications network  **104**. In some embodiments, the digital data corresponding to an individual subject may have been derived from medical testing or treatment or diagnostics reports. In some embodiments, the digital data may have been derived from other sources such as a research organization trial, insurance services, medical devices, or any other source. The digital records repository  **114**  may include a memory circuit and a processing unit for storing dynamically updating computer executable files aggregated from a plurality of changing private networks  **102**  such that the computer executable files contain dynamically updating digitally recorded information indicative of a set of changing subject attributes and respective changing reference values associated with the subject.

The digital records repository  **114**  may also include data related to different electronic or social sources such as doctor's visits, lab tests, hospital stays, clinical trials, patient problems, patients health information, patient habits, patient medical history, patient appointments, patient medical insurance, patient medical bills status, or any other information. The EMR system  **108**  may include or couple to other electronic or social data sources such as an HIE repository  **116**  and the VMR repository  **118**  to dynamically update information related to or from the other electronic sources. The HIE repository  **116**  may include electronic healthcare information related to a region, community, or hospital system. In examples, the HIE repository  **116**  may provide additional storage, retrieval, and manipulation of digital information such that the EMR system  **108**  can dynamically manage and update the digital data related to the entities. The HIE repository  **116**  may facilitate mobilization of digital information electronically across various repositories connected to the EMR system  **108** , across organizations within a region, community or a hospital. The HIE repository  **116**  may store information or medical records associated with the entities from disparate regions, or communities and allow to electronically move the information or the medical records among disparate health care information systems or repositories of the EMR system  **108**. The VMR repository  **118**  described herein may store electronic information related to the entities. The VMR repository  **118**  may be coupled to the EMR system  **108**  to store virtual medical records that may include a simplified, standardized electronic data designed to support interfacing to the EMR system  **108**  or clinical decision support systems. The present system can allow the entities to access and share or update the digital data in different sources or repositories of the EMR system  **108**.

The EMR system  **108**  may include or be coupled to an electronic record (ER) client  **122**  comprising a hardware device encapsulating software modules and various special purpose circuitry. The ER client  **122**  can be capable of monitoring, collecting, analyzing, and updating the digital data associated with the digital data sources  **124**. The detailed description about the ER client  **122**  will be provided in conjunction with FIG. 2.

FIG. 2, with reference to FIG. 1, illustrates generally, but not by the way of limitation, among other things, the ER client  **122**  such as described in FIG. 1, in accordance with various embodiments herein. The ER client  **122**  can be configured to monitor, collect, analyze, and update the digital data associated with the subject and collected from the digital data sources  **124**. In an example, the ER client  **122**  can be configured to expose a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) based web-service API (Application Program Interface) that allows the digital data sources  **124**  to push digital information in real-time directly into the EMR system  **108**  such that the ER client  **122**  may analyze the digital data and transfer a request to the EMR system  **108**  to update the stored digital information in the digital records repository  **114**  associated with the subject. The above specified protocol is only for exemplary purposes and the present system may use any other protocol capable of managing real-time flow of digital information from various sources over the communication network  **104**. As used herein, the term "real-time" may refer to seconds, minutes, or hours, by the way of definition of the particular application, EMR system  **108** , or enterprise being controlled and the like. For example, in a certain type of enterprise, the term "real time" may refer to propagating information from the sources within a few minutes or hours. In another enterprise application, the term "real time" may refer to propagating information from the sources substantially immediately, i.e., within a few seconds.

The ER client  **122**  may be configured to make a wireless connection with each of the private networks  **102**  and configured to query ER databases associated with each of the private networks  **102**  for electronic records residing within the private networks  **102**  or other data sources  **124**.

The ER client  **122**  includes various software and hardware modules such as for example, but not limited to, data monitoring module, data management module, security module, and business rules module. The data monitoring module of the ER client  **122**  monitors the digital data to discover any data updates related to the subject.

The digital data may include for example, but not limited to, long term care and nursing information, labs and research information, doctor's visits, medication administration records, physician orders, emergency information resource information, hospital stays, clinical trials, patient problems, patients health information, patient habits, patient medical history, patient appointments, patient medical insurance, patient medical bills status, medical devices associated with a subject, specifications and operating parameters of the subject, or any other information pertaining to the subject. The digital information described herein can be associated with the subject with the use of the 'subject identifier' uniquely defining the subject. This may be referred to as "patient association". In accordance with some embodiments, several automated and non-automated devices, sensors, and the like devices or equipment can be used in a shared environment like a hospital, or a clinic or any other environment. These devices and sensors, and the like may be used to monitor or record health parameters or information of the subject. For example, these devices can monitor or record information about blood pressure and other conditions or status of the subject. This monitoring and recording of the subject can be performed at several distinct times. For example, a subject may arrive in a hospital in the morning and get his health information recorded or monitored at that time while a second subject arrives in the evening when his health-related information is monitored or recorded. In some embodiments, the same devices may be used for monitoring or recording purposes of several subjects. The recorded or monitored information is stored in the EMR system  **108**  in association with the details of the respective subjects. This may allow the EMR system  **108**  to know which data elements or detail corresponds to which subject. Such patient association may allow the EMR system  **108**  to function in a proper and accurate manner. The EMR system  **108**  can easily trace records for specific patients through a "patient association" technique.

The ER client  **122**  is configured to include and use digital information of the subject from the one or more digital data sources  **124**  to update the real-time digital data associated with the subject via the data management module. Various entity applications  **202**  specific to each subject described herein may include for example, but not limited to, patient application, clinical application, lab application, admin application, health care application, financial organization application, insurance application, research organization application, or any other entity application. The ER client  **122**  can be configured to use the data management module to update the real-time digital data identified by the data monitoring module. The ER client  **122**  may update the data and based on the information propagated from the data monitoring module of the ER client  **122**. The ER client  **122**  may use identification information  **204**  associated with the subject to update the corresponding entity applications  **202**  and the digital records. The identification information  **204**  described herein, may include for example, but not limited to, subject specific information such as name, age, gender, phone number, contact details, subject identifier, and the like, entity meta data such as to quickly and precisely search for desired data, entity identifier (ID) such as an entity unique identifier, entity specific contextual data such as research notes pertaining to the entity, or any other identification information. The ER client  **122**  may further use the identification information  **204**  associated with the subject to identify corresponding electronic records to be updated in the digital records repository  **114**. This may include, for example, a mobile phone number, IP address of a computer and any other reference associated with the subject.

The ER client  **122**  may send a request to the EMR system  **108**  to update the corresponding digital data of a subject, in accordance with the identified real-time data associated with the subject. Likewise, in some examples, the EMR system  **108**  may allow the ER client  **122**  to interact with the digital data sources  **124**  to monitor and update the digital data propagated to or from the social cloud or private networks or social networks. The ER client  **122**  identifies the real-time data and sends a request to the EMR system  **108**  for dynamically updating the associated digital records repository  **114**. The EMR system  **108**  may run automated monitoring software to alert the subject about the updated records and associated data.

The security module and the business rules module may implement one or more security technologies and pre-determined business rules to provide secure access and updates to or from the EMR system  **108**  such that various subjects  **1** - **6**  can access and update their respective digital data, based on the roles and access levels, over the communication network  **104** , directly or indirectly via the ER client  **122**. In some embodiments, the ER client  **122**  is coupled to a data logger  **206** , as shown in FIG. 2. The data logger  **206**  is configured to retrieve data from various digital data sources  **124**  integrated or coupled or included to/within the EMR system  **108** , and log the data in the digital records repository  **114**. The digital records repository  **114**  can be contained within the EMR system  **108**. The data logger  **206**  is coupled to a visualizer  **208**  that is configured to retrieve the digital data from the data logger  **106**  or the EMR system  **108**  and visualize it such that a health care-specific task can be operated on it. In some embodiments, the visualizer  **208**  can generate visual reports that may or may not be tabulator in nature. The visualizer  **208**  provides an output that is simplified for a physician to make sense thereof.

FIG. 3, with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, is a schematic diagram that illustrates generally, but not by the way of limitation, an exemplary cloud computing architecture  **300** , in accordance with the various exemplary embodiments herein. One or more subjects such as subjects  **1** - **3**  as shown in FIG. 3 can access their respective digital data via an ER agent  **304**. The ER agent  **304**  described herein may be a software component running on the electronic data processing system of the respective subjects  **1** - **3**  or associated entities such as a caretaker or care provider. The ER agent  **304**  can be a web-based agent that may allow access to the respective digital data associated with the subjects  **1** - **3**  and stored in the digital records repository  **114**. The web-based agent may be accessed directly or indirectly. The direct access to the web-based agent can be done by the subjects  **1** - **3**  via a respective Uniform Resource Location (URL) address for each subject  **1** - **3**. The web-based agent can also be accessed indirectly by various subjects  **1** - **3**  via a social service interface or any other third party interface. The social service described herein can be, but not limited to a service such as provided by Facebook™, Orkut™, LinkedIn™, Twitter™, and the like. In an example, the ER agent  **304**  may be a standalone application configured to be installed on the electronic data processing systems of the subjects  **1** - **3**  or associated entities. The ER agent  **304**  can be configured to provide access to the various application modules of the ER system  **108** , based on roles and access levels. The ER agent  **304**  can be communicatively connected with the ER client  **122**  for allowing communication between the digital data sources  **124**  associated with the respective subjects  **1** - **3**  and the EMR system  **108**.

In an example, the digital data associated with the subjects such as the subjects  **1** - **3**  may be updated from the respective digital data sources  **124**  via the ER agent  **304**  in real-time over cloud  **308**  facilitated by the communication network  **104**. The ER client  **122**  may monitor the real-time information updates to or from the digital data sources  **124**  to identify corresponding records in the digital records repository  **114**  to be updated. The ER client  **122**  may transfer a request to update one or more computer executable files associated with the subjects  **1** - **3**  in the digital records repository  **114** , in accordance with the propagated real-time information. Likewise, the ER client  **122**  may also monitor the updates to or from a social service such as the social networking platform  **106**  providing access to the entities associated with the subjects such as the subjects  **1** - **3**  to update the digital data over the cloud  **308**.

A method for dynamically updating the digital data associated with the subjects  **1** - **3**  from the digital data sources  **124**  in the EMR system  **108** , in accordance with various embodiments, can also be employed. The ER client  **122**  of the EMR system  **108**  monitors real-time information updates from the digital data sources  **124**  via the ER agent  **304**. The ER client  **122**  identifies one or more electronic records to be updated, in accordance with the propagated real-time information. The ER client  **122**  transfers a request to update the corresponding electronic records associated with the subjects  **1** - **3**  to the EMR system  **108**.

The methods described herein may be deployed in part or in whole through a machine that executes software programs on a server, client, or other such computer and/or networking hardware on a processor. The processor may be part of a server, client, network infrastructure, mobile computing platform, stationary computing platform, or other computing platform. The processor may be include a computational or processing device capable of executing program instructions, codes, binary instructions and the like. The processor may be or include a signal processor, digital processor, embedded processor, microprocessor or any variant such as a co-processor (math co-processor, graphic co-processor, communication co-processor and the like) and the like that may directly or indirectly facilitate execution of program code or program instructions stored thereon.

In accordance with some embodiments, the EMR system  **108**  can control other devices (D **1** , D **2** , D **3** ) operating such as in a medical environment as shown in FIG. 4 and discussed later.

In some embodiments, the EMR system  **108**  and the devices can be integrated to provide the "device integration" functionality as discussed later. In some embodiments, the several devices such as D **1** , D **2** , and D **3**  can be integrated among themselves also while simultaneously coupled or integrated to the EMR system  **108**. In accordance with the device integration functionality, a device may be associated with a patient and the monitored or recorded data can be sent to the EMR system  **108**. The data sent may, for example, be sent from a specific device such as D **1**  or D **2**  and the like.

In accordance with some embodiments, a device such as D **1**  may be provided or used for a subject. In an example, if the subject is associated with the particular device D **1** , and when the EMR system  **108**  is used proximate to the device D **1** , the EMR system  **108**  automatically begins functioning in the context of the particular subject. In an embodiment, software can also be used to automatically connect to the subject simply based on the device D **1**  that the subject is connected or associated with. In an embodiment, each of the first medical device and the second medical device D **1**  and D **2**  may include respective (Global Positioning System) GPS-based devices such that the GPS-based devices are configured to detect geo-locations of the respective first medical device and the second medical device.

In some embodiments, the EMR system  **108**  may provide a functionality of device (D **1** , D **2** , and D **3** ) coordination. In accordance with the functionality of "device coordination", based on certain kinds of information received from a device such as blood pressure from a blood pressure device, a gateway can send a command to the EMR system  **108**  or to other devices to do some specific task. For example, a ventilator may be required to be turned off if an X-ray is taken during a surgical procedure. So, a message is required to be sent to the gateway and other related devices to turn the ventilator off while the X-ray is taken and once the X-ray has been taken, a command to switch on the ventilator is required to be given. The device coordination functionality allows the EMR system  **108**  and the devices (D **1** , D **2** , and D **3** ) to perform these tasks in a proper and coordinated way.

In still some other embodiments, the EMR system  **108**  may provide a functionality of device (D **1** , D **2** , and D **3** ) control. In an embodiment, if a device such as D **1**  is employed at a particular location within the medical environment, the EMR system  **108**  may show a button to indicate the device D **1** , and its association with the patient. For example, if the device D **1**  is a BP cuff tied to a subject, the EMR system  **108**  may indicate the location of the cuff and the association of the cuff with the patient by providing a button on a screen or user interface of the EMR system  **108**  that is configured to be pressed. As soon as the button is pressed on the user interface, the EMR system  **108**  sends a command to the cuff invoking it to measure the BP. A physiological sensor coupled to the patient or the cuff can send the recorded or monitored data to the EMR system  **108**. Thus, the "device control" functionality may provide the EMR system  **108**  to control the devices D **1** , D **2** , and D **3**  coupled to the EMR system  **108**.

In some embodiments, software may be provided that can automatically send a command to press the button on the user interface. By pressing the button, the device can automatically perform a desired task and send the monitored or recorded digital data to the EMR system  **108**.

In some embodiments, the device (D **1** , D **2** , D **3** ), can be or include a phone, a tablet, a computer or any other device that contains sensors, an accelerometer, GPS enabled devices, and the like. The various functionalities of the medical devices D **1** , D **2** , D **3**  are further discussed below in detail.

It must be appreciated that various embodiments as discussed above in conjunction with FIGS. 1-3 may be combined with various embodiments implementing device integration, device coordination, and device control functionalities as disclosed below in conjunction with FIGS. 4-11.

FIG. 4, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 3, illustrates a plurality of medical devices  **402**  (D **1** , D **2** , D **3** ) connected with the EMR system  **108**  through the network  **104**. The EMR system  **108**  stores digital data or electronic medical records of a plurality of subjects electronically. The medical records may include one or more of demographic information, medical history, treatment plans, ongoing treatments, information related to allergies, and lab reports of the plurality of subjects, and the like. In accordance with some embodiments, the medical records of the plurality of subjects stored in the EMR system  **108**  can be obtained socially through social aware networks (social network platform)  **106**  linked to the respective plurality of subjects or through other private networks  **102**  as discussed earlier. The medical records may also be referred to as social health records herein as they may be obtained from various socially aware networks.

The EMR system  **108**  may be coupled to a server machine or simply a server  **404**. The plurality of medical devices  **402**  may be coupled to the server  **404**  either locally or remotely so as to control functioning and coordination of the plurality of medical devices  **402**  based on information stored in the digital records repository  **114**  of the EMR system  **108**. The digitally stored information in the form of computer executable files may be associated with the plurality of subjects. For example, the EMR system  **108**  may collect data about the subjects and the associated devices  **402**  from various socially aware networks for example social networking websites or private networks and accordingly based on the data stored in the EMR system  **108**  can control and coordinate functioning of the devices  **402**. The stored data may be updated by the ER client  **122**  in real time. In an embodiment, the plurality of medical devices  **402**  may be integrated among themselves and also with the server  **404**. In an embodiment, the functioning of the plurality of medical devices  **402**  may be controlled or coordinated with respect to one another by the server  **404**. In an embodiment, the functioning of the medical devices  **402**  may be coordinated or controlled with respect to one another in a defined sequence. For example, the device D **2**  may operate after device D **1**  stops functioning for a defined period of time. The device D **3**  may operate only after D **2**  stops functioning for a defined period of time. Even more than one device can operate simultaneously based on the defined sequence by the server  **404**. The defined sequence can be determined by the server  **404**  based on for example information pertinent to a subject associated with the plurality of medical devices  **402** , information about the devices  **402** , functioning of the devices  **402** , medical condition of the subject, and level of requirement of the devices  **402**  for the subject under the given medical condition of the subject.

The server  **404**  may send instruction to the plurality of medical devices  **402**  associated with the subject such as subject  **406**  for proper coordination and control of the devices  **402**. The server  **404**  may include or be coupled to a processing unit  **408**. The server  **404**  may further include a communication interface  **410**  to communicate with the medical devices  **402**.

In an embodiment, the EMR system  **108**  and the server  **404**  may be deployed in a hospital facility to control and coordinate with medical devices associated with subjects in the entire hospital. In such embodiments, the EMR system  **108**  may be connected to hospital information systems to socially collect digital data from various information sources within the hospital. The EMR system  **108**  may further receive medical records associated with the subjects from outside the hospital environment through for example various socially aware networks or private networks. The socially aware networks may include various social networking websites that the subjects may be associated or registered with. The EMR system  **108**  may be accessed by authorized users of the hospital facility through a web based platform. In an embodiment, the EMR system  **108**  and the server  **404**  may be deployed to communicate with several hospital facilities and organizations such that the EMR system  **108**  may store information pertinent to subjects and medical devices of the entire hospital facilities and the organizations.

In an exemplary embodiment, the server  **404**  may connect with a plurality of medical devices in a hospital facility or any other medical environment even including multiple hospital facilities and organizations and detect and locate a medical device in the health care environment, initialize with the medical device and after initialization may remotely network with the medical device such that the EMR system  **108**  may be able to transmit and receive information from the medical device. For example, this may be done by connecting the EMR system  **108**  and the server  **404**  to Internet or other communication network or communication system.

In an exemplary embodiment, the server  **404**  can remotely monitor and diagnose the plurality of medical devices  **402**  associated with the subject  **406**. The server  **404**  can allow remote monitoring and diagnostics of a remotely located device from among the plurality of medical devices  **406**  once the medical device has been located and analyzed by the server  **404**  and relevant details about the device and the subject  **406**  associated with device are obtained and stored in the EMR system  **108**. In an example, the server  **404**  may connect to any of the plurality of medical devices  **402**  located within any health care facility and/or outside health care facility.

In an embodiment, the server  **404**  may be coupled to a device manager  **412**. The device manager  **412**  may be configured to manage device information corresponding to each of the plurality of medical devices and associate the information with respective subjects. For example, the device manager  **412**  may be responsible for managing the information of the devices D **1** , D **2** , and D **3**  and associate this information with the subject  **406**. In this manner, the processing unit  **408**  along with the device manager  **412**  can perform tasks such as monitoring and coordinating and controlling of the medical devices  **402**  in a health care facility. In some embodiments, the device manager  **412**  may be configured to detect newly connected medical devices or any updates in the existing medical devices associated with an already registered subject with the EMR system  **408**. For example, the device manager  **412**  can detect and locate a medical device D **1**  and identify the medical device D **1**  and authenticate it and provide an administrator or privileged access to the information relevant for the device D **1**  in the EMR system  **108**. The relevant information may for example be information pertinent to other medical devices such as D **2**  and D **3**  that coordinate with the newly detected medical device such as D **1**.

In accordance with various embodiments, a system is provided that is configured to be communicatively coupled with the EMR system  **108** , server  **404** , and the plurality of medical devices  **402**. The system may facilitate communication between the server  **404**  and the plurality of medical devices  **402**. The system may be responsible for managing the medical devices  **402**  associated with the subject  **406**  and facilitate coordinated functioning and integration and control of the plurality of medical devices  **406**  by providing a channel therethrough. The system is described later in conjunction with FIG. 5 below. In an embodiment, this system can be integrated within the server  **404**  or with the EMR system  **108**.

In accordance with some embodiments, the devices  **402**  can include, for example, a blood pressure (BP) cuff, X-ray machine, a ventilator, Electrocardiogram (ECG) device, radiotherapy device, dosing controller, medical resonance therapy related device, and the like devices.

FIG. 5, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 4, illustrates a system  **500**  for facilitating coordinated functioning of the plurality of medical devices  **402**  over the network  **104**. The system  **500**  may be coupled to the server  **404**  and the plurality of medical devices  **402**. The system  **500**  may facilitate communication between the server  **404**  and the plurality of medical devices  **402**. The system  **500**  may manage the medical devices  **402**  associated with the subject  **406**  and facilitate coordinated functioning and integration and control of the plurality of medical devices  **402**  by providing a channel therethrough.

The system  **500**  may include a communication circuit  **502** , and a control circuit  **504**. The communication circuit  **502**  may be configured to receive an input from the server  **404**  or the processing unit  **408**  coupled to the server  **404**. The input may be indicative of an action or a task to be performed by a first medical device such as D **1**  from among the plurality of networked medical devices  **402**. In an embodiment, each of the plurality of medical devices  **402**  may perform a unique task and each of the tasks performed by the plurality of medical devices  **402**  may be coordinated and dependent with respect to one another. The interdependence may be known to the server  **404**  and information about the interdependence of the tasks may be stored in the EMR system  **108**  in association with subject information corresponding to the medical devices  **402**. For example, a particular task performed by the first medical device D **1**  may not be desired along with the second task performed by the second medical device D **2**. In such cases, the server  **404**  sends the instruction to the system  **500**  which is received by the communication circuit  **502**  as the input. The received input by the communication circuit  **502**  provides a guidance that allows the medical devices  **402**  to function in a defined and desired manner and in accordance with the interdependence already known and stored in the EMR system  **108**. The interdependence may be decided by doctors or experts or persons treating the subject, or based on medical facts. The subject or the doctors or the persons treating the subject may convey the interdependence to the EMR system  **108**  through various channels such as through the socially aware networks  **106** , private networks  **102** , and the like. In an embodiment, the information about tasks interdependence may be automatically updated with the EMR system  **108**. In an embodiment, the EMR system  **108**  may automatically determine the information about the tasks interdependence as and when any medical device is registered with the EMR system  **108**  in association with a subject. The EMR system  **108**  may for example receive device related information and accordingly map the device information with other coordinating medical devices to define the interdependence. Once, the task interdependence is determined and known to the server  **404** , the functioning of the medical devices  **402**  may be coordinated and controlled accordingly based on the interdependence. The terms 'task' and 'action' are used herein throughout the draft interchangeably without any limitations.

The communication circuit  **502**  may be configured to send an instruction to the first medical device D **1**  to initiate the first task by the first medical device D **1**. The instruction may also include information about the details of the first medical device D **1**. In an embodiment, when the first medical device D **1**  functions for more than one subject, the instruction may also include information of the subject  **406**  associated with the first medical device D **1**. The information about the first medical device D **1**  and the subject  **406**  corresponding to the first medical device D **1**  may be stored in and retrieved from the EMR system  **108**.

The control circuit  **502**  may be configured to monitor the task performed by the first medical device D **1**  and receive an update periodically. In an event of a requirement of a second task performed by the second medical device D **2** , the system  **500**  may enquire the server  **404**  about interdependence of the first task and the second task and about the interdependence of the first medical device D **1**  and the second medical device D **2**. In an embodiment, the server  **404**  may retrieve the information about interdependence from a lookup table stored in the EMR system  **108**. The processing unit  **408**  may process information about the interdependence. In case, there is a conflict between the first task by the first medical device D **1**  and the second task by the second medical device D **2** , the server  **404**  may send the information about conflict to the system  **500**  accordingly. In another embodiment, the system  **500**  may not enquire about the interdependence rather instructions for performance or non-performance of the tasks are sent by the server  **404**  to the system  **500**.

The control circuit  **504**  may be configured to instruct the first medical device D **1**  to pause performing the first task for a defined period of time based on an instruction from the server  **404**  after determining tasks' interdependence information. The instruction may also be indicative of the second task to be performed by the second medical device D **2**. The predefined period of time may depend on various factors such as patient information, nature and type of the first and second medical devices D **1**  and D **2** , functioning and behavior of the first and second medical device D **1**  and D **2** , medical condition of the subject  **406** , degree of requirement and necessity of the first and second tasks for the subject  **406**  in light of the current medical condition of the subject  **406**. For example, if the second task is extremely necessary and vital for the current medical condition of the subject  **406** , the instruction may indicate to perform the second task for a time necessary to control criticality of the medical condition of the subject  **406**.

The control circuit  **504**  may include a time detection circuit  **506**  configured to monitor the defined period of time during which the first medical device D **1**  pauses performing the first task and the second medical device D **2**  performs the second task. The time detection circuit  **506**  may be configured to generate a signal upon completion of the defined period of time. The signal may be indicative of resuming the first task by the first medical device D **1**  and stopping of the second task by the second medical device D **2**. The time detection circuit  **506**  may be configured to initialize at a zero time value and monitor the passage of time until the monitored time equals the defined period of time after which the signal is generated indicative of the resuming of the first task by the first device D **1**  and stopping of the second task by the second device D **2**.

The control circuit  **504**  may include a device state detection circuit  **508**  coupled to the time detection circuit  **506**  and configured to identify an operating state of the plurality of medical devices  **402**. The operating state may be defined by performance or non performance of the medical devices  **402**. For example, the performance of the first medical device D **1**  may define a first operating state and non-performance of the first medical device D **2**  may define a second operating state of the first medical device D **1**. Similarly, the performance of the second medical device D **2**  may define a first operating state and non-performance of the second medical device D **2**  may define a second operating state of the second medical device D **2**. Based on interdependence between the first and the second tasks, the operating states of the first medical device D **1**  may depend on the operating states of the second medical device D **2**. For example, if the interdependence suggests a conflicting situation between the first and the second tasks, the first operating state of the first medical device D **1**  may not occur during occurrence of the first operating state of the second medical state D **2**. Therefore, either of the first and second medical devices D **1**  and D **2**  has to be in a non-performing operating state during the defined period of time.

The system  **500**  may include a switch matrix  **510**  that is configured to cause a switching action of the operating states. For example, the switching matrix  **510**  may be configured to cause switching of the first and the second medical devices D **1** , D **2**  from a performing operating state to a non-performing and from a non-performing state to a performing state based on an instruction from the control circuit  **504**. In an embodiment, the switch matrix  **510**  may cause switching of the operating states of one or more of the first medical device D **1**  and the second medical device D **2**  upon receipt of the instruction from the control circuit  **504**. In an embodiment, the switch matrix  **510**  may cause switching of the operating states of one or more of the first medical device D **1**  and the second medical device D **2**  upon receipt of the signal generated by the time detection circuit  **506**  that is indicative of completion of the defined time and of resuming the first task and stopping the second task. The resuming of the first task requires a switching of the non-performing state of the first medical device D **1**  to a performing state of the first medical device D **1**. The stopping of the second task by the second medical device D **2**  requires switching of the performing state to the non-performing state of the second medical device D **2**  by the switch matrix  **510**.

The control circuit  **504**  may include or be coupled to a frequency counter  **512**  configured to determine frequency of switching of operating states of the medical devices  **402**. For example, the frequency counter  **512**  may be configured to determine frequency of switching of the first medical device D **1**  from a performance state to a non-performance state of the first action and vice versa. Similarly, the frequency counter  **512**  can be configured to determine frequency of switching of operating states of other medical devices such as D **2**. In an embodiment, the frequency counter  **512**  may generate an output indicative of a current frequency of switching of an operating state of a medical device such as D **1**  and D **2**. The frequency counter  **512**  may further be configured to map the current frequency of switching with a threshold frequency established by the EMR system  **108**  based on a set of physiological parameters in association with the information associated with the subject  **406**. In an embodiment, the physiological parameters may include vital signs of the patient  **406**  and continuously detected by physiological sensors as discussed hereafter. The relevant information of the subject  **406**  may include for example without limitations degree of necessity of switching of the operating states of one device with respect to other device for the subject  **406** , age, gender, medical condition and other such subject-specific information. For example, an aged person in a critical condition may not tolerate frequent putting off of a ventilator machine and therefore a person responsible for patient care may not allow switching of the ventilator to an off state very frequently beyond a threshold limit. In an embodiment, the threshold limit may be defined for a unit period of time. For example, switching of a subject's ventilator from an on to off state may in certain conditions be not allowed beyond three times a day with each not more than 15 minutes. The frequency counter  **512**  may further be configured to reject the switching of the operating state of the first medical device D **1**  or the second medical device D **2**  if the current frequency of switching equals the threshold frequency for the respective medical devices D **1** , D **2**. For example, upon receipt of the instruction by the communication circuit  **502**  to switch the first medical device D **1**  from the performing state to the non-performing state for the defined period of time, the request for switching may be rejected by the frequency counter  **512**  if the current frequency already reached the threshold frequency.

In accordance with various embodiments, there should be a consistency in output generated by the time detection circuit  **506**  and the device state detection circuit  **508**. For example, upon completion of the defined time and its detection by the time detection circuit  **506** , there should be a change in an operating state of the first medical device D **1**  from a non-performance to a performance state. Therefore, both the time detection circuit  **506**  and the device state detection circuit  **508**  should lead to a state of shift which should be consistent. In an event of an inconsistency, a fault may occur. The system  **500**  further includes a fault detection circuit  **514**  configured to generate a signal indicative of a fault if the device state detection circuit  **508**  does not detect a change in the operating states of either of the first and second medical devices D **1** , D **2**  upon receipt of the instruction from the control circuit  **504**  to initiate or pause the first action and upon generation of the signal by the time detection circuit  **506**  to stop the second action and resume the first action on completion of the defined time. The signal generated by the fault detection circuit  **514**  may be transmitted to the EMR system  **108**  through the communication circuit  **502**  to determine optimal states of the first medical device D **1**  and the second medical device D **2**  upon detection of the failure. The optimal states can be other than what is initially instructed by the server  **404**  to the system  **500**  for example to switch the first medical device D **1**  to non-performing state and to switch the second device D **2**  to performing state for the defined time. The server  **404**  may be configured to determine the optimal states of the first and second medical devices D **1** , D **2**  based on the information of the subject  **406**  associated with the first medical device D **1**  and the second medical device D **2**. For example, the server  **404**  may determine an alternative treatment technique to fulfill the requirement that is not achieved because of the detection of the fault. In an embodiment, the server  **404**  can send an instruction to the system  **500**  to guide a subject caretaker to manually attend the subject  **406**. There can be several reasons for the fault. One reason may be malfunctioning of the first and/or the second medical device D **1** , D **2**. In such cases, the defaulted medical device may be replaced. Another reason may be a rejection by a medical device to follow the instruction sent by the control circuit  **504**  or the switch matrix  **510**  to switch the operating states. The rejection may occur because at least one medical device may be authorized to reject the instruction in some embodiments. For example, the first medical device D **1**  may be authorized to reject to pause performing the first task based on the instruction received from the control circuit  **504**. The rejection by the first medical device D **1**  influences the second task to be performed by the second medical device D **2**. In such cases, the first medical device D **1**  may coordinate with other medical devices but may not be completely controlled by the system  **500**  to function in a defined manner. This is because the first medical device D **1**  is provided a privilege to reject the request for switching the state. In other embodiment, however, the first medical device D **1**  may not be authorized to reject the request for switching and may be completely controlled by the system  **500**. In an event of rejection, the server  **404**  may be informed about the rejection to determine an alternative action for the second medical device D **2**  or an alternative medical device to replace the need of the second medical device D **2**  by a third device to perform a third task (that may be similar or alternative to the second task) in a manner that the first medical device D **1**  has no objection with the third task. For example, the first medical device D **1**  may not reject because the third action may be defined in a manner that it may not need pausing of the first task, and the first and the third tasks may be performed simultaneously because of a specific interdependence between them. The server  **404**  may in some embodiments determine the alternative tasks or medical devices with the use of the interdependence information saved in the EMR system  **108**  or in a memory of the system  **500**.

In some embodiments, the system  **500**  may include a physiological sensor  **515**  configured to be coupled to the subject  **406**  to identify a set of physiological characteristics of the patient  **406**  during performance and non-performance and/or before/after switching operations of the first and the second medical devices D **1** , D **2**. The physiological characteristics may be one or more of blood pressure, heart beat, respiratory rate, body temperature, and glucose level, and other such characteristics without limitations. In an example, the switching of the operating state for example from performance to non performance or vice versa of the first and second medical devices D **1** , D **2**  based on the instruction received from the server  **404**  may be rejected upon indication of a change in the physiological characteristics beyond respective threshold values corresponding to each of the physiological characteristics. The physiological sensor  **515**  may determine indicative values of the one or more physiological characteristics of the subject  **406**  before switching and after switching, and upon a change in the characteristics beyond the threshold limit, the request for switching from the server  **404**  may be rejected. In an embodiment, the physiological sensor  **515**  may forecast possible changes that may occur in the physiological characteristics after switching based on the subject-specific information, information about the characteristics and other medical information stored in the system  **500**. Based on the determined values of the physiological characteristics before switching and possible forecast values after switching, the request for switching may be rejected if the change in the values of the physiological characteristics is beyond the threshold limit. In an embodiment, the physiological characteristics may include without limitations blood pressure, heart beat, respiratory rate, body temperature, and glucose level. The physiological sensor  **515**  may be coupled to the subject  **406**  for monitoring the various physiological characteristics. In an embodiment, the physiological sensor  **515**  may be implanted within a patient body. In an embodiment, the physiological sensor  **515**  may be implanted as a standalone component. In another embodiment, the physiological sensor  **515**  may be implanted as a component of another implantable device already implanted in the body such as a pacemaker or a defibrillator, or any other implantable device.

In an embodiment, the threshold values of the physiological characteristics may be determined and updated regularly by the processing unit  **408**  of the server  **404**  and stored in the EMR system  **108**  in real time. The updating of the threshold values can depend on an update in subject-specific information such as age, disease, gender, and height-weight index of the subject  **406**  and the like information and are communicated to the system  **500**  for storage locally within the system  **500**  in real time. The system  **500**  may store information about the threshold values of the physiological characteristics in a memory circuit  **516**. The memory circuit  **516**  may further store the information received from the processing unit  **408**  coupled to the server  **404**  and subject-specific information obtained from the EMR system  **108**.

In an embodiment, the EMR system  **108**  may be configured to store medical records of a plurality of subjects including the subject  **406**. The medical records may be associated with the plurality of subject and may be obtained socially through the social aware networks  **106**  or other private networks  **102**  linked to the respective plurality of subjects. For example, the subject  **406**  may register him with a social networking website and upload his medical information and the server  **404**  may retrieve information from the website and store in the EMR system  **108**. The EMR system  **108**  may function as a two way communication database which can access digital federated records from the socially aware networks  **106**  or private networks  **102**  of the subjects for collecting and collating the digital medical records and also serve as a repository to be accessed by the subjects from anywhere to view and access their digital records at a single location. In various embodiments, the digital medical records may include one or more of demographic information, medical history, treatment plans, ongoing treatments, information related to allergies, and lab reports of the plurality of subjects.

FIG. 6, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 5, illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the medical devices D **1**  and D **2**  coordinating through and controlled by the system  **500**. As shown, the first medical device D **1**  is a ventilator and the second medical device D **2**  is an X-ray machine. The ventilator D **1**  is shown in the first operating state which is defined by performing the first task that is providing artificial life support to the patient  **406**. The second medical device D **2**  is shown in the second operating state which is defined by non-performing the second task by the second medical device D **2**. The first task may be dependent on the second task. As shown, the interdependence between the first task and the second task is such that when the first medical device D **1**  operates to provide artificial ventilation, the second medical device D **2**  stays off. Therefore, the X-ray D **2**  machine is shown as in an off state or in the second state of non-performing of the task of radiating to capture an X-ray. This interdependence may be established based on well known medical reasons that an X-ray should not be taken while a patient is on a ventilator machine. Similarly, in some other examples, the interdependence can be established based on various other factors also such as discussed above.

FIG. 7, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 6, shows the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 6 after switching of the operating state of the first medical device D **1**  based on the instruction received from the switch matrix  **510**  or the control circuit  **504**. The interdependence between the ventilator D **1**  and the X-ray machine D **2**  is of the type that the X-ray machine D **2**  will operate only when the ventilator D **1**  is off. Therefore, the instruction of switching includes sending a request to the ventilator D **1**  (first medical device) to pause delivering the artificial ventilation and sending a request to the X-ray machine D **2**  (second ventilator) to activate its task that is delivering radiation for capturing the X-ray. The FIG. 7 therefore shows the ventilator D **1**  in an off state for the defined time and the X-ray machine D **2**  in an on state for the defined time. The defined time may be based on various factors as discussed above. One of them may be the level of necessity of the ventilation by the patient  **406**. For example, if the subject  **406**  is under critical condition, ventilation may be paused for a very short period of time only. If the subject  **406**  is in an extremely critical condition, then the task of taking the X-ray may altogether be postponed or rejected. The server  **404**  may be updated accordingly in case of the postponement or rejection. The EMR system  **108**  may maintain a log of such rejections or postponements for the patient  **406**  so as to accordingly refine the interdependence of the various tasks performed by various medical devices associated with the subject  **406**  for future use. For example, in the future for a defined time such as three days, the system  **500**  may not instruct the X-ray machine D **2**  to operate in view of the refined interdependence established and stored in the EMR system  **108**  when the ventilator D **1**  is on.

FIG. 8, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 7, illustrates exemplary listing of interdependence in the look up sheet maintained by the EMR system  **108**. It must be noted that the interdependences are dynamic in nature and are updated after periodic intervals or in real-time. The real time updating can be done with the use of the ER client  **122**  discussed in FIG. 2. As shown, in examples, when D **1**  performs its task, D **2** , D **3** , and D **6**  cannot perform or operate in their performing state. When D **2**  operates in the performing state, D **1** , D **3** , and D **8**  cannot perform. When D **3**  performs D **1** , D **2** , and D **9**  cannot operate to perform. When D **4**  performs, D **10** , and D **12**  cannot perform. When D **4**  performs, D **13** , and D **16**  remain uninfluenced that is whether D **13**  or D **16**  or both perform or not, they do not affect operating state of the D **4**. When D **2**  performs, D **4**  has to perform.

In some embodiments, priority of performance by different medical devices may be established. For example, if the device D **1**  cannot perform with the devices D **2** , D **3** , and D **6** , then which devices(s) should perform with a higher priority. This may be determined dynamically based on several factors for example as discussed above including without limitation subject current medical condition, affect of performance or non-performance of a device on the subject medical condition, nature and functioning of the devices and their relationship with the medical condition of the subject, and the like. For example, if it is determined that D **2**  is more needed by the subject and gets a higher priority over D **1** , then D **1**  will be put in an off state that is non-performing state and D **2**  starts performing. A device that may possess a higher priority with respect to a particular device may possess a lower priority with respect to another device.

It must be appreciated that though the above discussion includes various embodiments that involve the use of two medical devices D **1**  and D **2** , it must be appreciated that more than two medical devices may also be employed equally without limiting the embodiments herein. For example, the system  **500**  may facilitate coordinated functioning of the plurality of devices (two or more than two) coupled to the system  **500**. The EMR system  **108**  may store the digital medical records (interchangeably referred to as or digital data without limitations) of the subject  **406**  and information related to a sequence of operations to be performed by the plurality of the medical devices based on interdependence among the plurality of the medical devices, identification information of the devices, and subject-specific information. The server  **404**  may use the stored information to guide the system  **500**  to instruct the plurality of devices accordingly in the defined sequence. It must be appreciated that the though the above discussion and the figures include one subject associated with medical devices, several subjects each associated with one or more devices may also be coordinated and controlled accordingly without any limitation.

FIG. 9, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 8, illustrates a method  **900**  for facilitating coordinated functioning of the plurality of medical devices over the network  **104**. At step  **902** , the method  **900**  includes receiving the input indicative of the first action to be performed by the first medical device D **1**  from among the plurality of networked medical devices  **402**. The input is received from the server  **404**  coupled to the EMR system  **108**. At step  **904** , the method  **900**  includes sending the instruction to the first medical device D **1**  to initiate the first action by the first medical device D **1**  in association with the information of the subject  **406**  associated with the first medical device D **1**  stored in and retrieved from the EMR system  **108**. At step  **906** , the method  **900**  includes monitoring the first task performed by the first medical device D **1**  in accordance with the instruction. At step  **908** , the method  **900**  includes instructing the first medical device D **1**  to pause performing the first task for the defined period of time based on the instruction from the server  **404**  indicative of the second action to be performed by a second medical device D **2**.

In an embodiment, the method  **900**  may further include monitoring the defined period of time during which the first medical device D **1**  pauses performing the action, and the second medical device D **2**  performs the second action. The method  **900**  may include generating a signal upon completion of the defined period of time by the time detection circuit  **506**. The signal may be indicative of resuming the first action performed by the first medical device D **1**  and stopping of the second action performed by the second medical device D **2**. The method  **900**  may further include detecting an operating state of the second medical device D **2** , by the device state detection circuit  **508** , which defines performance or non performance of the second action by the second medical device D **2**  during the defined time period. The operating state of the first medical device D **1**  that defines performance or non performance of the first medical device D **1**  may be based on the operating state of the second medical device D **2**. The method  **900**  may also include determining the interdependence between the operating states or the tasks performed by the first medical device D **1**  and the second medical device D **2**. The method  **900**  may also include switching the operating states of the one or more of the first medical device D **1**  and the second medical device D **2**  upon receipt of the instruction from the controller circuit  **504**  and upon generation of the signal by the time detection circuit  **506**. The method  **900**  may also include generating a signal indicative of a fault by the fault detection circuit  **514**  if the device state detection circuit  **508**  does not detect a change in the operating states of either of the first and second medical devices D **1** , D **2**  upon receipt of the instruction from the controller circuit  **504**  to initiate or pause the first action and upon generation of the signal by the time detection circuit  **506**  to stop the second action and resume the first action on completion of the defined time.

In an embodiment, the method  **900**  may employ the plurality of medical devices  **402**  including even more than two medical devices. The method  **900**  may include in such cases determining a sequence of operations performed by the plurality of medical devices  **402**. The sequence of operations may depend on the interdependence of the tasks performed by the plurality of the medical devices  **402**. In cases of conflict between at least any two tasks, the method  **900**  may also include determining a priority task to be performed over other interdependent tasks. The priority may be determined based on various parameters as discussed above.

In an embodiment, the method  **900**  may include identifying measures or values of physiological characteristics of the subject  **406**  before switching an operating state of a medical device D **1** , D **2**. The method  **900**  may further include identifying measures or values of physiological characteristics of the subject  **406**  after switching the operating state of the medical device D **1** , D **2**. The method  **900**  may further include determining a change in the measures of the physiological characteristics and mapping the measures with the threshold values of the physiological characteristics under defined conditions. The method  **900**  may include rejection switching of the operating state upon determining the change as exceeding the threshold level of the physiological characteristics. For example, if the switching involves putting a ventilator in an off state for thirty minutes, the method  **900**  may determine the change either after switching for a short time or forecasting an affect of putting the ventilator in the off state without actually putting it off. If the change is unacceptable for example of the heart beat goes extremely down below the threshold level, the request for switching the ventilator in the off state may be rejected.

It must be appreciated that various embodiments discussed in conjunction with FIGS. 1-3 may be combined with various embodiments implementing the device integration, device coordination, and device control functionalities as disclosed in conjunction with FIGS. 4-11.

FIG. 10 illustrates a distributed architecture-based system  **1000**  for a multi-device module  **1002**  in accordance with an embodiment. In the example herein, the multi-device module  **1002**  includes two devices, however, in other embodiments; more than two devices may be employed without limitations.

The distributed architecture-based system  **1000**  (hereafter referred to as system  **1000** ) includes the physiological sensor  **515**  (also referred to as physiological sensor  **515**  elsewhere interchangeably without limitations) associated with a body of a subject. The physiological sensor  **515**  is configured to sense one or more physiological characteristics of the subject  **406**  and generate a digital physiological signal. The digital physiological signal is indicative of an instantaneous physiological state of the subject  **406**. The instantaneous physical state may represent momentary physical state of the subject  **406**  at a particular moment of time. The physical state may include such as heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar level, pulse rate, cardiac rhythm, and the like that may be captured using a specific component of the physiological sensor  **515**  or using multiple physiological sensors for detecting each type of physiological signal. The instantaneous physical state may change at every moment and accordingly the physiological sensor  **515**  may intermittently or regularly sense the physiological characteristics of the subject  **406**  and generate the corresponding digital physiological signal(s). In an example, the physiological sensor  **515**  may be implanted within a patient's body subcutaneously to sense intrinsic physiological characteristics. In an example, the physiological sensor  **515**  is associated with the subject  **406**  as an external device.

The system  **1000**  includes a first device  **1004**  of the multi-device module  **1002**  configured for bi-directional wireless communication and positioned proximate to the subject  **406**. The first device  **1004**  may be a medical device and may include a memory circuit and a processor. The first device  **1004**  may be configured to generate a signal indicative of an operating state of the first device  **1004**. The operating state may be a performing state or a non-performing state of the first device  **1004**. The system  **1000**  may include a second device  **1006**  of the multi-device module  **1002**  which may also be configured for bi-directional wireless communication and may be positioned proximate to the subject  **406**. The second device  **1006**  may also include a memory circuit and a processor similar to that of the first device  **1004**. The second device  **1006**  is configured to generate a signal indicative of an operating state of the second device  **1006**. The operating state can be one of a performing state and a non-performing state of the second device  **1006**. In some examples, the first device  **1004**  and the second device  **1006**  are configured to perform one of a therapeutic, diagnostic, and a medication delivery task on the subject in accordance with instructions obtained from an external computing device  **1008**  or from the EMR system  **108**  or manually by an operator.

The system  **1000**  may include a remote-control device  **1010**  positioned apart from the physiological sensor  **515** , the first device  **1004** , and the second device  **1006**. In an example, the first device  **1004** , second device  **1006** , and the physiological sensor  **515**  may be connected with the computer  **1008**  such that the remote-control device  **1010**  is communicatively connected with the first device  **1004** , second device  **1006** , and the physiological sensor  **515**  through the computer  **1008**. The computer  **1008**  may be located at a remote location from the remote-control device  **1010**. The computer  **1008**  may include telemetry circuitry  **1012**  for communicating with the physiological sensor  **515** , the first device  **1004** , and the second device  **1006**.

The remote-control device  **1010**  may include the EMR system  **108**  as discussed above. The EMR system  **108**  may include the digital records repository  **114**  which may include a memory circuit and a processing unit for storing dynamically updating computer executable files aggregated from the plurality of changing private networks and social networks or any other digital data sources  **124**. The computer executable files may contain dynamically updating digitally recorded information (the digital data as discussed earlier). The dynamically updating digitally recorded information or simply digital data may store information about a set of attributes associated with the subject that may reflect subject's vital and/or health parameters among other things. These medical parameters may be associated with changing reference values associated with the subject  **406**. For example, one of the attributes may be subject's cardiac rhythm recorded by an ECG machine such that reference values as identified in an ECG report may be defined along with the attribute. If the subject  **406**  or any associated entity repeats the ECG, new values may be associated with the attribute of the subject  **406**. These attributes and the associated reference values may change as new medical records of the subject  **406**  get added in the EMR system  **108**. The varying reference values of the subject  **406**  for the set of parameters are indicative of medical status of the subject  **406**  at a particular time. However, these reference values are subject to updating of the medical records from the digital data sources  **124**  or by the subject  **406**. The reference values associated with the attributes may in certain cases be different than the information aggregated in real-time from the physiological sensor  **515**  which may demand an immediate intervention as discussed hereafter.

The EMR system  **108**  may include the ER client  **122**. The EMR system  **108**  may include or be communicatively connected with the server machine  **404**  (also referred to as server simply) as discussed earlier. Among the various tasks the server machine  **404**  may perform, the server machine  **404**  may also be configured for communicating with the physiological sensor  **515** , the first device  **1004** , and the second device  **1006**  either directly or through the computer  **1008**  associated with the first device  **1004** , second device  **1006** , and the physiological sensor  **515**. In an example, the computer  **1008**  may send a request for service to the server machine  **404**  which may indicate a request for operation of any of the devices in association with the subject  **406**  for delivering a particular medical procedure, therapy, performing diagnosis, delivering medication, etc. The server machine  **404**  may be configured to receive the service request and also receive the physiological signal from the physiological sensor  **515**  either directly or through the computer  **1008**. The server machine  **404**  is configured for receiving the digital physiological signal indicative of the instantaneous physiological state of the subject  **406**  and sending programmable operational parameters to the first device  **1004**  and the second device  **1006**  in response to the request for service from the computer  **1008**  and based on the instantaneous physiological state. The operating parameters decide operating characteristics of the first device  **1004**  and operating characteristics of the second device  **1006**  such as whether the first device  **1004**  and/or the second device  **1006**  should execute certain tasks and for what duration and in which precedence and priority. The operating characteristics of the first device  **1004**  and the operating characteristics of the second device  **1006**  are interdependent through priority and interdependence relationships as discussed earlier.

The server machine  **404**  may also receive a signal from the computer  **1008**  or along with the physiological signal indicative of an identity of the subject  **406** , the first device  **1004** , and the second device  **1006** , in an embodiment. In an embodiment, the identity of the subject  **406**  can be defined from the service request and the identity of the associated medical devices can be determined from the EMR system  **108**  for the subject  **406**.

The system  **1000**  may include an identity validation device  **1014**  coupled to the server machine  **404**  to verify identity of the first device  **1004**  and the second device  **1006**  and associate a subject identifier uniquely representing the subject  **406**  with the first device  **1004**  and the second device  **1006**  based on information contained within the physiological signal or the service request such that the operating parameters are calculated based on one or more of the reference values associated with the subject  **406**  having the unique subject identifier as identified based on the physiological signal. In an example, the physiological sensor  **515**  is configured for the subject  **406**  such that the digital physiological signal contains the subject identifier along with an information indicative of the instantaneous physiological state of the subject  **406**. In an embodiment, the identity is known from the service request. In an embodiment, the computer  **1008**  may send the service request along with details of the sensed physiological signal and the associated medical devices and identity of the subject  **406**  such that the identity may be verified using certain identifiers such as the subject identifier associated with the request from the computer  **1008**.

The remote-control device  **1010**  may be configured to associate the subject identifier with the computer executable files stored in the digital records repository  **114**  to retrieve the reference values associated with the subject  **406**  and generate an output indicative of the operational parameters of the first device  **1004**  and the second device  **1006**  based on the physiological signal and the retrieved reference values associated with the subject  **406**. The reference values may indicate health state and medical procedures of the subject  **406**  and the medical devices  **1004**  and  **1006**  associated with the subject  **406**  and operational guidelines for the medical devices  **1004**  and  **1006**  in association with the subject  **406**  such that the remote-control device  **1010**  can accordingly guide the medical devices  **1004**  and  **1006**  for the operations based on the medical records contained in the computer executable files for the subject  **406**.

The operational parameters may include one or more of changing an operating state of the first device  **1004**  only for a first period of time, changing an operating state of the second device  **1006**  only for a second period of time, changing an operating state of both the first device  **1004**  and the second device  **1006**  for a third period of time, and connecting a third device different from the first device  **1004**  and the second device  **1006**  by associating an operating state with the third device in association with the subject  **406**  for a fourth period of time. Each of the first device  **1004** , the second device  **1006** , and the third device are uniquely identified by device identifiers such that the digital records repository  **114**  stores the digital identifiers in the device manager  **412**  or a memory in association with the subject identifier. The switch matrix  **510**  may be configured to cause switching of the operating state of the one or more of the first device  **1004** , second device  **1006** , and the third device upon receipt of the operational parameters from the remote-control device  **1010**  in accordance with the priority and interdependence relationships. The remote-control device  **1010**  may include the time detection circuit  **506**  configured to monitor the first period of time, second period of time, third period of time, and the fourth period of time. The remote-control device  **1010**  may include the device state detection circuit  **508**  coupled to the time detection circuit  **506**  and configured to identify an operating state of the first device  **1004** , second device  **1006** , and the third device after completion of the first period of time, second period of time, third period of time, and the fourth period of time. The remote-control device  **1010**  may include the fault detection circuit  **514**  configured to generate a signal indicative of a fault if the device state detection circuit  **508**  does not detect a change in operating states of either of the first device  **1004** , second device  **1006**  or the third device in accordance with the operational parameters transmitted by the remote-control device  **1010**.

The EMR system  **108**  may also include a mobile point of care system  **1016**  to capture subject-associated digital data at a point of care. The point of care system  **1016**  may be defined as a location where the subject  **406**  is located or the subject  **406**  is cared in a hospital premise such that the mobile point of care system  **1010**  may be transported to various locations to capture the digital data associated with the subject  **406**. The point of care system  **1016**  is communicatively connected with the electronic record (ER) client  **122**  so as to transmit the electronic records or digital data captured by the mobile point of care system  **1016**  from the private networks  **102**  or from devices associated with the subject  **406**  to the server machine  **404**. The mobile point of care system  **1016**  may provide a data interface  **1018**  in communication with the mobile point of care system  **1016**  to facilitate transmission of the electronic records to the server machine  **404**. The point of care system  **1016**  may capture the digital records using bar codes, QR codes, data sharing techniques, or manual entries by the subject  **406** , Near Field communication techniques, and the like. The point of care system  **1016**  may include a subject data capture facility to enter information provided by a subject  **406**  or associated medical devices, a subject data repository, in communication with the point of care system  **1016**  and with external systems, to store the subject data for access by the point of care system  **1016**  and then transmit to the server machine  **404**  or the remote-control device  **1010**. In this way, the paint of care system  **1016**  may capture each piece of data at its source at the time of entry to provide a complete audit trail for all subject associated digital data.

The point of care system  **1016**  captures subject-associated data in real-time at the point of care, that is, where healthcare providers interact with their subjects or medical devices interact with the associated subjects. For example, physicians can use the point of care system  **1016**  to enter, access, process, analyze and annotate data from subject records in real-time at the point of care. Thus, using the point of care system  **1016** , a physician, who has many subjects in a hospital, can visit each subject in their room, access their electronic records there, enter results of current diagnosis, evaluate their medical history, electronically annotate their x-rays images and prescribe medications and treatments instantaneously as the point of care system  **1016**  captures and organizes subject-associated data into the medical records stored in the subject data repository. The point of care system  **1016**  may likewise communicate with a reference database to assist a healthcare provider in making diagnoses, prescribing medications and administering treatments.

The EMR system  **108**  may also configure a web-based interactive graphical user interface  **1020**  for alternatively allowing the subject  **406**  to enter the digital records manually from a distant location.

In an embodiment, one or more of the physiological sensor  **515** , the first device  **1004** , the second device  **1006** , and the computer  **1008**  are configured to transform the operating parameters into a digital data structure which may be readable by a scanner  **1022**. The digital data structure may be a QR (quick response) code.

In an example as shown in FIG. 11, the first device  **1004**  is a medical imaging device such as an X Ray machine and the second device  **1006**  is a life support system such as a ventilator such that the functioning of the medical imaging device  **1004**  is dependent on the functioning of the life support system  **1006**  such that the EMR system  **108**  controls the interdependence of the functioning of the medical imaging device  **1004**  and the life support system  **1006**  from a remote location through the computer  **1008**.

The first device  **1004**  includes an integrated device gateway  **1102**  configured to have a multiple interface unit comprising data interface units. The integrated device gateway  **1102**  is configured to send medical operation measurements which may represent operational details in conformity with the operational parameters received via a wired/wireless communication network from the remote-control device  **1010**  directly or through the computer  **1008**. The integrated device gateway  **1102**  can ensure, through recording of information and measurements and transmission to the computer  **1008**  and/or the remote-control device  **1010** , the operation of the first device  **1004**  is in accordance with the operational parameters received from the remote-control device  **1010**. Similarly, the second device  **1006**  can also include a similar integrate device gateway  **1104**  which measures performance of the second device  **1006**.

Each of the first device  **1004**  and the second device  **1006**  may contain one or more of a therapeutic device, a medication delivery device, and a diagnosis device physically contained within the respective device housing  **1106**  and  **1108**  and configured to perform one of a therapeutic, diagnostic, and a medication delivery task depending on the nature of the first device  **1004**  and the second device  **1006**.

In an embodiment, the first device  **1004**  and the second device  **1006**  can respectively contain a first identification module  **1110**  and a second identification module  **1112**  to respectively contain digitally stored information indicative of device identifier and configured to be transmitted to other devices such as the remote-control device  **1010**  and the computer  **1008**  upon request for device identification. The computer  **1008**  may include the telemetry circuitry  **1012**  which allows communication with the physiological sensor  **515**  and the first device  **1004** , and the second device  **1006**. The computer  **1008**  may be configured to receive the physiological signal from the associated physiological sensor  **515**  configured for the subject  **406**. The computer  **1008**  may be configured to transmit a subject identifier, a first medical device identifier associated with the first medical device  **1004** , and a second medical device identifier associated with the second medical device  **1006**  along with the service request to the remote-control device  **1010**  located apart. The remote-control device  **1010**  is configured to fulfill the service request based on information contained in the plurality of dynamically updating computer executable files obtained from the plurality of digital data sources  **124**  and stored in the EMR system  **108**. The computer  **1008**  is further configured to receive the operational parameters from the remote-control device  **1010**  in response to the service request from the computer  **1008**  and based on the instantaneous physiological state as identified from the physiological signal such that the one or more operating parameters decides operating characteristics of the first medical device  **1004**  and operating characteristics of the second medical device  **1006**  as discussed earlier in the document.

As shown in the exemplary illustration, the first device  **1004**  is the medical imaging machine for imaging of a target such as a tissue or a bone structure within a body of the subject  **406**. The imaging machine includes a rotatable drive shaft  **1114**  made of a rigid material and configured to rotate along multiple axes. The medical imaging machine includes an imaging device  **1116**  supported on the rotatable drive shaft  **1114**. The imaging device  **1116**  is adapted to transmit energy toward the target such as in the form of X rays or magnetic energy. The medical imaging device includes a position adjustment mechanism  **1118**  coupling with the rotatable shaft  **1114**  to allow adjustment of the rotatable drive shaft  **1114**  in order to focus transmission of the energy at the target by aligning along the multiple axes.

The second device  **1006**  is the life support system. The life support system includes an oxygen source  **1120**  that includes a tank of pressurized gas. The life support system further includes one or more control valve  **1122**  disposed over a channel connecting the oxygen source  **1120**  and the subject  **406**  to allow the oxygen to flow from the tank/source  **1120**  to a laryngeal mask  **1124**  in a first state and to allow gas expelled from the subject  **406**  to flow from the laryngeal mask  **1124**  to the atmosphere in a second state while preventing the oxygen from flowing from the oxygen source  **1120**  in a second state. The life support system includes the laryngeal mask  **1124**  disposed downstream from the one or more control valve  **1122**. The laryngeal mask  **1124**  may be configured to form an air seal with the subject's respiratory tract such that the oxygen flows from the oxygen source  **1120**  to the lungs of the subject  **406**. The life support system may include a timer (not shown) for synchronizing actuation of the one or more control valve  **1122**  based on the operational parameters received from the remote-control device  **1010**.

The oxygen source  **1120**  may contain pressurized oxygen which may be supplied as per requirements by controlling supply from such as a supply regulator and a pressure gauge (not shown). The oxygen source  **1120**  stores substantially pure oxygen under pressure. The pressure of oxygen within the oxygen source drops during use because gas is supplied to the subject but not returned to the oxygen source. In one aspect, a medical-grade compressed-oxygen cylinder is used. In an example, the life support system is a ventilator.

In accordance with embodiments, a device such as the first device  **1004**  and second device  **1006**  may be provided or used for a particular subject such as  **406**. In an example, if the subject  **406**  is associated with the particular device, and when the EMR system  **108**  or the computer  **1008**  is used proximate to the device, the remote-control device  **1010**  automatically begins functioning in the context of the particular subject  **406**. In an embodiment, software can also be used to automatically connect to the subject  **406**  simply based on the device that the subject  **406**  is connected or associated with.

The centralized management system  **1202**  may be configured to protect the network  **104**  from any potential threat or vulnerability. In an embodiment, the centralized management system  **1202**  may store a list of software and/or hardware assets that may be integrated within the medical devices  **1004**  and  **1006**  in a repository. Each of these assets may be vulnerable to particular threats. The centralized management system  **1202**  may also store associated potential vulnerabilities for each of the assets and also create a mapping between the assets and respective potential vulnerabilities. The centralized management system  **1202**  may also associate a rank to each vulnerability and asset combination which may be indicative of overall effect on the network  **104**  and ultimately allowing the centralized management system  **1202**  to make a decision whether the medical devices  **1004**  and  **1006**  are trustworthy enough to be integrated within the network  **106**  or not. The centralized management system  **1202**  may continuously monitor the vulnerabilities and the assets from a plurality of information sources and keep updating nature of association between the assets and the vulnerability now and then.

In an embodiment, the centralized management system  **1202**  may not be tied to the EMR  **108**  and may be deployed separately and may be configured to influence the medical devices  **1004**  and  **1006**  independently.

In embodiments, the centralized management system  **1202**  may include or connected to a risk information source receiving risk information, and generating a risk assessment report based on the risk information. The centralized management system  **1202**  may include or connected to an asset information source, and an analysis system that correlates one or more risks with one or more assets. In various embodiments, the centralized management system  **1202**  may generate a risk assessment report from the correlated risk information and asset information. The centralized management system  **1202**  may assess for risks globally that occur in any region or country throughout the world, for any type of risk or any type of asset.

The embodiments herein are discussed above with respect to the medical devices  **1004**  and  **1006**  located along with the subject in a hospital or any other medical premise which is connected communicatively with the EMR  **108**  and the server  **108**. In some embodiments, however the medical devices  **1004**  and  **1006**  may be located at certain other premises such as at home of a subject wherein the medical devices  **1004**  and  **1006**  may be used to monitor certain parameters of the patient and/or perform certain tasks based on monitored parameters by sensing devices around the subject such as the physiological sensor  **515**  as discussed earlier.

In accordance with certain embodiments, the devices may or may not be medical devices, and may include sensors or wearables or any other intelligent devices that may be located around an entity such as the subject or anyone else to sense the contextual parameters. These devices may be controlled by the EMR to perform certain tasks based on the monitored contextual parameters around the subject. For example, a sensor may be deployed to monitor humidity levels around the subject and as soon as the humidity levels reach a particular level, the device (a humidifier) may be informed to operate in accordance with custom rules coming from EMR in association with subject-specific information so as the humidity to be managed at the desired level for a particular subject in accordance with medical or comfort needs.

In an example, the tangible non-transitory computer readable medium can be configured to include the set of instructions, which when performed by a device, can cause the device to perform acts similar to the ones described here. Embodiments herein may also include tangible and/or non-transitory computer-readable storage media for carrying or having computer executable instructions or data structures stored thereon.

Generally, program modules include routines, programs, components, data structures, objects, and the functions inherent in the design of special-purpose processors, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Computer executable instructions, associated data structures, and program modules represent examples of the program code means for executing steps of the methods disclosed herein. The particular sequence of such executable instructions or associated data structures represents examples of corresponding acts for implementing the functions described in such steps.

The techniques provided by the embodiments herein may be implemented on an integrated circuit chip (not shown). The chip design is created in a graphical computer programming language, and stored in a computer storage medium (such as a disk, tape, physical hard drive, or virtual hard drive such as in a storage access network). If the designer does not fabricate chips or the photolithographic masks used to fabricate chips, the designer transmits the resulting design by physical means (e.g., by providing a copy of the storage medium storing the design) or electronically (e.g., through the Internet) to such entities, directly or indirectly. The stored design is then converted into the appropriate format (e.g., GDSII) for the fabrication of photolithographic masks, which typically include multiple copies of the chip design in question that are to be formed on a wafer. The photolithographic masks are utilized to define areas of the wafer (and/or the layers thereon) to be etched or otherwise processed.

The resulting integrated circuit chips can be distributed by the fabricator in raw wafer form (that is, as a single wafer that has multiple unpackaged chips), as a bare die, or in a packaged form. In the latter case the chip is mounted in a single chip package (such as a plastic carrier, with leads that are affixed to a motherboard or other higher level carrier) or in a multichip package (such as a ceramic carrier that has either or both surface interconnections or buried interconnections). In any case the chip is then integrated with other chips, discrete circuit elements, and/or other signal processing devices as part of either (a) an intermediate product, such as a motherboard, or (b) an end product. The end product can be any product that includes integrated circuit chips, ranging from toys and other low-end applications to advanced computer products having a display, a keyboard or other input device, and a central processor.

The embodiments herein can include both hardware and software elements. The embodiments that are implemented in software include but are not limited to, firmware, resident software, microcode, etc.

A data processing system suitable for storing and/or executing program code will include at least one processor coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus. The memory elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code, bulk storage, and cache memories which provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution.

Input/output (I/O) devices (including but not limited to keyboards, displays, pointing devices, etc.) can be coupled to the system either directly or through intervening I/O controllers. Network adapters may also be coupled to the system to enable the data processing system to become coupled to other data processing systems or remote printers or storage devices through intervening private or public networks. Modems, cable modem and Ethernet cards are just a few of the currently available types of network adapters.

A representative hardware environment for practicing the embodiments herein is depicted in FIG. 13, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 12. This schematic drawing illustrates a hardware configuration of an information handling/computer system  **1300**  in accordance with an exemplary embodiment herein. The system  **1300**  comprises at least one processor or central controller (CPU)  **1310**. The CPUs  **1310**  are interconnected via system bus  **1312**  to various devices such as a random access memory (RAM)  **1314** , read-only memory (ROM)  **1316** , and an input/output (I/O) adapter  **1318**. The I/O adapter  **1318**  can connect to peripheral devices, such as disk units  **1311**  and storage drives  **1313** , or other program storage devices that are readable by the system. The system  **1300**  can read the inventive instructions on the program storage devices and follow these instructions to execute the methodology of the embodiments herein. The system  **1300**  further includes a user interface adapter  **1319**  that connects a keyboard  **1315** , mouse  **1317** , speaker  **1324** , microphone  **1322** , and/or other user interface devices such as a touch screen device (not shown) to the bus  **1312**  to gather user input. Additionally, a communication adapter  **1320**  connects the bus  **1312**  to a data processing network  **1325** , and a display adapter  **1321**  connects the bus  **1312**  to a display device  **1323** , which provides a GUI (e.g., a gadget) in accordance with the embodiments herein, or which may be embodied as an output device such as a monitor, printer, or transmitter, for example. Further, a transceiver  **1326** , a signal comparator  **1327** , and a signal converter  **1328**  may be connected with the bus  **1312**  for processing, transmission, receipt, comparison, and conversion of electric or electronic signals.
