FIG. 1A illustrates an exemplary architecture  **100**  for managing healthcare functions in accordance with an embodiment herein. The architecture  **100**  may include a control server  **102**  communicatively connected with a remote control device  **104**  over a network  **106**  when the remote control device  **104**  is in the proximity of or within an interaction zone  **108**. The interaction zone  **108**  may be a physical space with defined technical capabilities such as a hospital, a nursing center, home of a patient or any other location where a patient may be situated and that may possess capabilities of receiving and/or sending computer executable instructions from/to the control server  **102**.

In accordance with the illustrated embodiment, the control server  **102**  is remotely located from the interaction zone  **108**. In other embodiments, the control server  **102**  may be configured within the interaction zone  **108**. The interaction zone  **108**  provides a dedicated facility for controlled and secured healthcare information storage, exchange and solutions delivery. For example, the interaction zone  **108**  may be enabled to be networked through the network  **106**  so as to allow communication between the control server  **102**  and the remote control device  **104**  whenever the remote control device  **104**  is in the proximity of the interaction zone  **108**. The remote control device  **104**  may be a handheld device, a patient monitoring device, a mobile device, or a mobile phone, or a customized remote device with pre-launched application layers for executing a set of applications enabling communication of the computer executable instructions across the network  **106** , and the like. The remote control device  **104**  may be configured to receive computer executable instructions from the control server  **102**  and allow information exchange between the control server  **102** , the remote control device  **104** , and other similar remote control devices operating within the interaction zone  **108**  or in association with a patient within the interaction zone  **108**.

The control server  **102**  is communicatively coupled with a processing circuit  **110**  for executing computer readable instructions stored within the control server  **102**  or received from the control server  **102**  for allowing performing a set of tasks by a practitioner by communicating a message to the remote control device  **104**  through the network  **106**.

In embodiments, the remote control device  **104**  may include such as a user computer or any other computing device or handheld device that includes input devices (such as a keyboard, mouse, microphone, etc.) and output devices (such as a monitor, printer, or speaker, etc.). The remote client device  **104**  may also include network connections to other devices, computers, networks, servers, etc., that are connected to the network  **106**. In some embodiments, the network  **106**  is a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), an intranet or extranet, or a combination thereof. Communications with the network are implemented using wired and/or wireless technologies. Other configurations may be possible.

In some examples, the practitioner may include such as a doctor, physician, or other persons or groups or institutions, other healthcare providers, other service providers or other types of professionals, or group of professionals or institutes etc who may be authorized to perform the set of tasks on patients or other relevant persons within the interaction zone  **108**.

The remote control device  **104**  may communicate with the processing circuit  **110**  and the control server  **102**  through the network  **106**.

FIG. 1B, with reference to FIG. 1A, illustrates an exemplary architecture  **120**  for authorizing the user and managing healthcare functions in accordance with an embodiment herein.

In an embodiment, an authorization interface  **122**  receives input from the user for authorizing the user to access the interaction zone  **108**  or the remote control device  **104**. In an embodiment, the authorization interface  **122**  may be a specific device connected to the processing unit  **122**  or the control server  **102**. In an embodiment, the authorization interface  **110**  is integrated with the processing circuit  **110**. In an embodiment, the authorization interface  **122**  is included in or integrated with the control server  **102**.

In an embodiment, authorization interface  **122**  is configured to implement one or a plurality of user authorization or authentication policies. User authorization policy may include manual input of credentials by the user. In an embodiment, user authorization policy may include reading an identification card by the authorization interface  **122**. The identification card may be a unique card issued to the user, or a card with specific credentials unique to the user.

In an embodiment an authorization device  **124**  is configured to authenticate the communication received from the user. In an embodiment, the authorization device may be a specific device connected to network  **106**  and the remote control device  **104**. In an embodiment, the authorization device  **124**  may be integrated in network  **106** , or integrated in the remote control device  **104**.

The authorization device  **124**  may be configured to use the authorization policy implemented by the authorization interface  **122**. For example the authorization device  **122**  may be configured to verify the credentials manually entered by the user, or be configured to verify the information generated through using the identification card of the user.

FIG. 2, with reference to FIG. 1A through FIG. 1B, illustrates a detailed block diagram of the processing circuit  **110**  among other things, in accordance with an embodiment herein. The processing circuit  **110**  may be coupled to the control server  **102** , a tasks repository  **202** , and an electronic medical records database  **204**. The control server  **102**  may be further communicatively coupled with the tasks repository  **202**  and the electronic medical records database  **204**. The electronic medical records database  **204**  may store computer executable patient files or computer executable patient data. In an example, the electronic medical records database  **204**  may be a dedicated data center for retrieving and storing patient data through integrated devices associated with patients. In this case, the computer executable patient data may be device generated data obtained from the integrated devices over the network  **106**  in a secured manner. In an example, the electronic medical records database  **204**  may store computer executable patient medical files, computer executable patient historical records or prescriptions, and the like. Each computer executable electronic medical record or patient file is associated with a first identification code that is indicative of a patient's identity. Each computer executable electronic medical record is further associated with a second identification code that is indicative of a practitioner associated with the patient. Each computer executable electronic medical record is further associated with a third identification code that is indicative of a set of tasks recommended by the practitioner associated with the patient in a last visit for the patient so that the third identification code directly links the computer executable electronic medical records stored in the electronic medical records database  **204**  with the tasks repository  **202**  that stores the set of tasks associated or scheduled to be associated with the patient at a future time occurrence. The tasks repository  **202**  stores the set of tasks associated with the patient. The tasks repository  **202**  may be communicatively connected with an interface engine that provides a communication link between the tasks repository  **202**  and the electronic medical records database  **204**  so as to associate the set of tasks with the computer executable patient files for generating a user configurable updated set of tasks list when the practitioner or the remote control device  **104**  is within the interaction zone  **108**.

The processing circuit  **110**  includes a time series module  **206**  that executes computer readable instructions to define a time series and associate a current time occurrence and a future time occurrence on the time series. In an example, the future time occurrence is in relation to a successive time slot on the time series as compared to the current time occurrence. The current time occurrence is predefined and may be defined as a reference to the future time occurrence. In an example, the current time occurrence may be associated with a practitioner's current or last visit in the interaction  **108**  zone in association with the first identification, and/or second identification code and/or third identification code for performing certain tasks for the patient. In an example, the future time occurrence may be predefined based on the first identification code and/or second identification code, and or third identification and/or the set of tasks last performed. In an embodiment, the future time occurrence may not be predefined and the future time occurrence is associated to be defined in real time based on an occurrence of an event in future time that occurs at a successive slot in the time series in relation to the current time occurrence. The successive slot may be associated with a next event occurrence or after an event has occurred defined times such as two, three or four times.

The processing circuit  **110**  further includes a tasks list engine  **208**  that generates the set of tasks associated with the patient and associates the third identification code with the set of tasks list so generated by the tasks list engine  **208**.

The processing circuit  **110**  may be communicatively coupled to an event monitor  **210**  to detect or receive an input pertinent to the event or triggering event that triggers scheduling or performing of the set of tasks within the interaction zone  **108**. In an example, the triggering event may be a weather controlled event. In an embodiment, the triggering event may be a spatial presence that is indicative of a presence of the remote control device  **104**  associated with a practitioner with a defined identification code within the interaction zone  **108**  at the future time occurrence.

The event monitor  **210**  may include a location sensor  **212**  that detects the spatial presence of the remote control device  **104**  within the interaction zone  **108**. The location sensor  **212**  may include a GPS instrument or any other type of monitoring device. The event monitor  **210**  may further include a weather sensor  **214**  that monitors weather parameters or weather controlled triggering events such as humidity, rains, temperature, and the like.

In an embodiment, the processing circuit  **110**  may include a rules engine  **216**  that executes computer readable instructions for developing and/or executing a set of rules that cause the practitioner to perform a task from the set of tasks lists based on occurrence of a triggering event as identified from the received input from the event monitor  **210**  that may include one or a plurality of sensors, cameras, scanners and the like. The rules engine  **216**  may execute different tasks for different triggering events based on the input received from the event monitor  **210**. The rules engine  **216**  may execute the set of computer executable rules that are stored within the control server  **102**  or an external repository located within the interaction zone  **108**  or outside the interaction zone  **108**.

In an example, the event monitor  **210**  may be communicatively connected with the processing circuit  **110**  through data aggregators that may aggregate data from the various sensors contained within the event monitor  **210**. The data may be communicated to the processing circuit  **110**  through various gateways.

The processing circuit  **110**  launches an activation message when the input indicative of the triggering event is received. The message is sent to the remote control device  **104**  by a communication circuit  **218**  over the network  **106**  that is displayable over the remote control device  **104**  and is indicative to perform a task from the set of tasks by the practitioner associated with the remote control device  **104**  at the future time occurrence upon occurrence of the triggering event in accordance with the established rules. Once the task is performed by the practitioner at the future time occurrence, the remote control device  **104**  may send a message to the processing circuit  **110**  to update the set of tasks list and the time series automatically and dynamically based on performance status of the task by the practitioner. In case the task is successfully performed, the current time occurrence replaces the future time occurrence and a new future time occurrence is defined on the time series based on an input from the remote control device  **104**  that is indicative of a health status of the patient. For example, the time series may redefine and associate the future time occurrence for the next slot on the time series or next visit of the practitioner within the interaction zone  **108**  if the patient health status indicates a critical situation. On the contrary, if the patient recovery is expected to speed up, the future time occurrence may be associated after a certain number of slots on the time series such as after three visits of the practitioner and the like and not on the consecutive visits or consecutive weather controlled events and the like. The slots on the time series may represent different instances associated with the triggering events. For example, next visit instance of a practitioner with a defined identification code in the interaction zone  **108**  may be referred to as a next slot on the time series wherein the practitioner's visit is a triggering event.

FIG. 3, with reference to FIGS. 1A through 2, illustrates a method flowchart  **300**  for facilitating performance of a healthcare task, in accordance with an embodiment herein.

The method may include defining an interaction zone rule at step  **302**. For example, the defining of the interaction zone rule may include defining a time series. The method may further include associating the interaction zone rule for one or more participants at step  **304**. In an example, the associating of the interaction zone rule may include associating the current time occurrence and the future time occurrence on the time series. In an example, the future time occurrence may be associated with next time event occurrence schedule. For example, the future time occurrence may refer to a point on the time series when an event occurs next time such as when the remote control device  **104**  is detected to be present in the interaction zone  **108**  next time or when the weather sensor  **214**  detects a weather controlled triggering event next time relative to the current time occurrence on the time series. In various examples, the interaction zone rule may be based on weather-related events, location, time, and the like parameters.

At step  **306** , the set of tasks list is created by the processing circuit  **110**. The tasks list has been described above in conjunction with FIG. 2. Each tasks list is associated with the third identification code. Further, each task within the tasks list may be associated with a fourth identification code that is indicative of the task and the tasks list that contains the task. In an example, the tasks and the tasks list may be associated and mapped with the triggering events in accordance with the set of rules defined by the rules engine  **216**. For example, the tasks list may be sliced into tasks or a group of tasks for different triggering events that necessitate scheduling of the tasks or group of tasks from the tasks list. Each such mapped task or group of tasks may be associated a fifth unique identification code that is indicative of the group of tasks and the corresponding triggering event.

The processing circuit  **110**  establishes the set of rules that defines scheduling and performance of a task from the set of tasks based on occurrence of a triggering event. In view of the established rules, when a triggering event occurs and a related input is received from the event monitor  **210**  by the processing circuit  **110** , the processing circuit  **110**  may notify the remote control device  **104**  by launching an activation message that is displayable on the remote control device  **104**  at step  **308**. The activation message includes an instruction to inform the practitioner to perform the task at the future time occurrence upon occurrence of the triggering event in accordance with the established rule.

Once the task is performed by the practitioner at the future time occurrence, the remote control device  **104**  may send a message to the processing circuit  **110**  to update the set of tasks list and the time series automatically and dynamically based on performance status of the task by the practitioner at step  **310**. In case the task is successfully performed, the current time occurrence replaces the future time occurrence and a new future time occurrence is defined on the time series based on an input from the remote control device that is indicative of a health status of the patient.

An embodiment herein provides a computer-implemented method for scheduling, tracking, and executing performance of the set of tasks. The processing circuit  **110**  may define the time series. The processing circuit  **110**  may associate the current time occurrence on the time series and the future time occurrence on the time series. The future time occurrence may be defined as a succeeding time occurrence on the time series in relation to the current time occurrence. For example, the future time occurrence may be associated with the next time the triggering event occurs, in an example. In an example, the future time occurrence may be associated with the next time a practitioner visits the interaction zone or the next time a defined temperature, humidity level, or rain is sensed by the event monitor in the interaction zone. The processing circuit  **110**  may create a tasks list including the set of tasks. The tasks list may include an actionable questionnaire, a test plan, a process verifier, a runbook, a careplan, a regulatory mandate that each may be editable and executable at the future time occurrence. In an embodiment, the future time occurrence may be defined with respect to the triggering event so that when the triggering occurs after a defined number of times or next time, the future time occurrence is noted by the processing circuit  **110**  to allow the set of tasks to be executed. The execution and performance of the tasks may be locked until the defined future time occurrence. The set of tasks included within the work list may remain pending till the future time occurrence. The performance and execution of the tasks based on associated future time occurrence or the time series and the triggering event may be initiated based on the interaction zone rule as identified by the processing circuit  **110**  through user defined parameters. The interaction zone rule may include defining a plurality of triggering events, by the processing circuit  **110** , to initiate the set of tasks. For example, the interaction zone rule may define execution of the set tasks in a specific series when a specific weather controlled event is detected at the future time occurrence within the interaction zone. In an example, the interaction zone rule may define execution of the set of tasks in a specific series when the spatial presence of the remote device is detected within the interaction zone at the future time occurrence. In various other embodiments, the interaction zone rule may be defined in accordance with different governing parameters.

The processing circuit  **110**  may associate the interaction zone rule with one or more participants including a health practitioner, a patient, and the like. For example, the interaction zone rule may be custom defined specific to a patient and associated healthcare practitioner. The patient and the health practitioner may be identified through identification codes executable by the processing circuit  **110**. The processing circuit  **110**  may schedule a task from the set of tasks at the future time occurrence relative to the current time occurrence based on occurrence of the triggering event in view of the interaction zone rule. The control server may receive a signal indicative of an output from an event monitor. The output signifies the triggering event at the future time occurrence. The processing circuit  **110**  processes the signal and notifies the remote device for performance of the scheduled task at the future time occurrence upon detection of the triggering event. The step of notifying may include generating an electric signal comprising data signifying the schedule task and instructions for performance of the scheduled task, transmitting the electric signal from the control server, communicatively connected with the special purpose processing circuit  **110** , in a network comprising a plurality of communicatively linked data communication devices, converting the electric signal into a plurality of pixels, and displaying the plurality of pixels on a display unit of the remote device to launch an activation message that includes an instruction to perform the task at the future time occurrence upon occurrence of the triggering event in accordance with the interaction zone rule. Once the task is performed by the healthcare practitioner or a medical device, the remote device may generate a signal indicative of performance status of the task and health status of the patient. The signal may be transmitted to the control server. The control server may receive a message from the remote device to update the set of tasks list and the time series dynamically based on performance status of the task. For example, the set of tasks lists may be modified to consider the task having performed and updating the time series accordingly. This may include replacing the current time occurrence by the future time occurrence and defining a new future time occurrence on the time series based on the performance status of the task and an input from the remote device that is indicative of health of a patient. The new future time occurrence may be defined to be executed in accordance with the interaction zone rule but may be dynamically updated even before the execution of next task occurs. The dynamically updates can be done based on the health status of the patient, recommendation from the remote device or associated health practitioner and the like.

In an example, the interaction zone rule is applied in association with an interaction zone defined by physical coordinates of a geographical location such that the triggering event is indicative of an entry of the remote device within the geographical location bounded by the physical coordinates at the future time occurrence. The spatial presence of the remote device within the interaction zone may be detected with the use of a location sensor physically located within the interaction zone or associated with the remote device and capable of detecting transition of the remote device from outside to within the interaction zone.

In an example, the interaction zone rule is applied in association with an interaction zone defined by physical coordinates of a geographical location such that the triggering event is indicative of a weather controlled event occurrence within the geographical location bounded by the physical coordinates at the future time occurrence. The monitoring of weather parameters or the weather-controlled triggering event may be done with the use of a weather sensor physically located within the interaction zone or associated with the remote device and capable of sending detected signals indicative of the weather-controlled triggering event to the control server. The weather-controlled triggering event may include such as rain, humidity, and temperature, and the like such that the weather sensor may include a rain sensor, a temperature sensor, and a humidity sensor. The weather sensor may be capable of sending signals to the control server indicative of occurrence of the weather-controlled triggering event only at the future time occurrence.

The method steps discussed above may be executed with the use of a computer-controlled system for scheduling, tracking, and executing performance of the set of tasks that may include the control server. The control server may be configured to communicatively connect with the remote device through a network for allowing exchange of computer executable patient data between the control server and the remote device. The system may include the processing circuit  **110**  included within or communicatively connected with the control server. The processing circuit  **110**  may be configured to define the time series, associate a current time occurrence on the time series, and associate a future time occurrence on the time series. The processing circuit  **110**  may create a tasks list including the set of tasks. The processing circuit  **110**  may define the interaction zone rule in association with the time series, associate the interaction zone rule with one or more participants, and schedule a task from the set of tasks at the future time occurrence relative to the current time occurrence based on occurrence of a triggering event in view of the interaction zone rule. The processing circuit  **110**  may be configured to receive an input indicative of the triggering event at the future time occurrence. The processing circuit  **110**  may notify the remote device for performance of the scheduled task at the future time occurrence upon detection of the triggering event. The processing circuit  **110**  may be configured to receive a message from the remote device to update the set of tasks list and the time series dynamically based on performance status of the task. The computer-controlled system may include the event monitor comprising a location sensor and a weather sensor communicatively connected with the control server for detecting spatial presence and a weather controlled event respectively upon occurrence of the triggering event.

The computer-controlled system further comprising an electronic medical records database communicatively connected with the control server. The electronic medical records database stores computer executable patient data files. Each of the computer executable patient data files is associated with a first identification code that is indicative of a patient's identity, a second identification code that is indicative of a practitioner associated with the patient, a third identification code that is indicative of a set of tasks recommended for performance, in association with the patient, by the practitioner at the current time occurrence. In an example, the current time occurrence is associated with a last visit of the practitioner in the interaction zone for the patient. In an example, the future time occurrence is associated with occurrence of the triggering event such that the future time occurrence is set to occur after a predefined number of the triggering event has occurred within the interaction zone. The predefined number is dynamically adjusted by the processing circuit  **110**  based on an input received from the remote device including a computer executable file signifying health status of the patient and a recommendation note by the practitioner. The interaction zone is defined to exhibit preset capabilities within a defined spatial coordinate of a geographical location to allow information exchange between the control server and the remote device within the interaction zone. The performance of the set of tasks is limited within the spatial coordinates of the interaction zone in view of the interaction zone rule.

The embodiments herein provide several advantages. For example, if a healthcare practitioner visits an elderly patient for routine checkup, glucose monitoring, blood analysis, blood pressure check etc and something is required from the patient but the practitioner may not want it done all the time or make a special trip for it, the embodiments herein may let the practitioner setup the tasks list and then establish a rule that next time when a triggering event occurs at specific conditions; e.g. entering the facility or going of a patient to home, or when patient arrives and checks in the hospital, a task or a groups of tasks are driven.

The embodiments herein define a correlation between spatial or weather-related coordinates and the set of tasks using the set of rules from the rules engine  **216**  to generate health management guidelines and performance or scheduling of healthcare tasks contained within the tasks lists for several patients.

The embodiments herein associate the next time occurrence of a triggering event so as to ensure priority tasks are scheduled next time when the triggering event occurs. Accordingly, based on available healthcare resources and requirements, priority ratings may be associated with the different tasks scheduled to occur with respect to different patients or on the same patient. Based on the priority ratings, the time series is dynamically updated for multiple tasks associated with future time occurrences for the same patient or different patients. For example, a task which holds a higher priority rating based on defined constraints and parameters may be scheduled to occur next time the triggering event occurs and accordingly is associated with the next future time occurrence of the triggering event for the patient in combination with a practitioner scheduled to perform the task.

The embodiments herein may be used in healthcare industries. Alternatively, the embodiments herein may be used in other industries. For example, when a sales person or a company representative visits the interaction zone  **108**  next time, the processing circuit  **110**  may trigger the remote control device  **104**  to perform a defined set of tasks or execute a specific work list or task list. In another example, when a maintenance engineer visits the interaction zone  **108**  for dealing with water heating issues in a building, the processing circuit  **110**  may trigger the remote control device  **104**  to perform some additional tasks for other maintenance issues of the building at the future time occurrence.

In accordance with some embodiments, methods and systems are discussed hereafter for creating and managing the work lists (or tasks lists used interchangeably without limitations).

FIG. 4, with reference to FIGS. 1A through 3, illustrates a block diagram of a work lists management system  **400**  (or tasks lists management system  **400**  or system  **400**  simply used interchangeably without limitations) for managing the work lists communicatively coupled with the processing circuit or the processor  **110**  (referred to herein interchangeably without limitations. The system  **400**  may include a work lists module  **402**  for creating a work list with necessary tasks. The system  **400**  may further include a database  **404**  containing a set of libraries as will be discussed hereafter.

The template engine  **406**  may further provide design tools to generate work lists of specific designs. A scheduling module  **408**  processes scheduling tasks and accordingly tie different tasks of the work lists on a time series and identifies timelines associated with the different tasks. An evaluation module  **410**  examines status of the tasks on the time series and generates an automated output indicative of tasks status. A notification unit  **412**  automatically notifies other systems about status of the tasks as soon as they are complete or if they are pending after due time.

In an embodiment, the system  **400**  can be configured to be included within the processing circuit  **110**  or coupled with the processing circuit for performing one or more functions of the processing circuit  **110**  as discussed in conjunction with FIGS. 1A through 3. In an embodiment, the system  **400**  may perform one or more functions performed by the tasks lists engine  **208**. In an embodiment, the system  **400**  may perform one or more functions performed by the rules engine  **216**. In an embodiment, the system  **400**  may perform one or more functions performed by the time series module  **206**.

FIG. 5, with reference to FIGS. 1A through 4, illustrates a dashboard  **500**  configured to provide an interface for interacting with the system  **400**  to allow a user to navigate through different options for work lists creation and management facilitated by the system  **400**. As depicted, the dashboard  **500**  presents assigned organizations, projects, users, and feedback options for a particular user.

The interface  **600**  further depicts list of tasks that form a part of the checklists or the work lists assigned to the user or being executed by the user.

FIG. 7, with reference to FIGS. 1A through 6, illustrates another section of a user interface  **700**  that provides tabs for accessing various libraries contained within the system  **400**. The libraries may include a projects library, a work lists library, a task library, a roles library, a form library, a script library, a reference library, and the like. As depicted in FIG. 8, with reference to FIGS. 1A through 7, the work lists library  **800**  contains different folders or work lists assigned to a user. New work lists can be created under this library or existing work lists can be edited by authorized persons. The task library allows defining tasks or selecting or editing tasks for a work list. In an example, the task library may include predefined tasks that may be used directly for the wok list. A user may for example pick a task from the task library based on a category of the task such as software, networking and the like and add it to the work list in the time series. The form library includes well defined forms that may be imported to a work list. The role library includes various roles with defined access priorities. The script library includes runnable codes or scripts for executing a particular task.

The interaction zone  **108**  may define relationships and interaction among the participants and the processes performed by them within the interaction zone  **108**  in association with a defined work list executed by the work lists management system  **400**. The interaction may be based on weather, time, location, and the like parameters. The processes may be performed when a triggering event occurs within the interaction zone  **108**  and accordingly the different processes may be allocated and collaborated among the participants by the work lists management system  **400**. In an example, the web application  **1006**  and the mobile application  **1008**  are run on the user end where the work lists may be designed. In an example, the web application  **1006**  and the mobile application  **1008**  may be located remotely. The business APIs  **1002**  may be centralized or may be distributed. The business APIs  **1002**  may be located within a server hosting the work lists management system  **400**.

FIG. 13 illustrates an ecosystem  **1300**  of a work lists management system such as the worklists management system  **400**  interacting with a variety of systems or devices within an interaction zone such as the interaction zone  **108** , in accordance with an embodiment herein. The ecosystem  **1300**  may include a section A, a section B, and a section C. The sections A, B, and C are illustrated in FIGS. 14, 15, and 16 respectively in detail.

Referring to the FIGS. 13-16, the ecosystem  **1300**  is discussed herein. The section A includes a processing circuit  **1402** , a stack of API layers including a plurality of APIs  **1404** , and a memory circuit  **1406**  storing the APIs  **1404** , and a work lists storage repository  **1408**. The processing circuit  **1402**  is configured to generate a computer executable worklist such as the worklists discussed elsewhere in the document which may include a plurality of tasks similar to the tasks as discussed elsewhere in the document. The tasks may be scheduled to be executed at the future time occurrence on the time series based on occurrence of a triggering event in view of an interaction zone rule. The interaction zone rule may be indicative of a spatial presence and a weather controlled event within the interaction zone  **108**  as discussed in conjunction with various other figures above. In an embodiment, the plurality of tasks may include a first task, a second task, and a third task. The first task may be executable by a first device  **1502** , the second task may be executable by a second device  **1504** , and the third task may be executable by a third device  **1506** , in accordance with an embodiment herein. The first device  **1502**  may be controlled by a first execution server  **1508** , the second device  **1504**  may be controlled by a second execution server  **1510** , and the third device  **1506**  may be controlled by a third execution server  **1512**  as shown in FIG. 15 such that the first execution server  **1508** , the second execution server  **1510** , and the third execution server  **1512**  are located remote from one another and remote from the processing circuit  **1402**  in a distributed environment.

Each of the first device  **1502** , the second device  **1504** , and the third device  **1506**  may operate under different interaction zone rules in an embodiment such that for example the second device  **1504**  may perform the second task upon an entry of the first device  **1502**  within the interaction zone  **108**  next time only after the first task is performed by the first device  **1502**  based on occurrence of a weather controlled triggering event. The interaction zone rule for the second device  **1504**  in this case may represent spatial presence of the second device  **1504**  within the interaction zone  **108**  and association of a sequential task performance with respect to the first device  **1502**  while the interaction zone rule for the first device  **1502**  may represent occurrence of a weather controlled triggering event as identified from such as a weather sensor as discussed above without limitations.

The processing circuit  **1402**  may be communicatively connected with the worklists storage repository  **1408**. The worklists storage repository  **1408**  may include a worklists library  **1410**  containing predefined and user editable worklist templates. The worklist templates may include such as a survey template, a check list template, a care plan template, a questionnaire template, and a protocol template, and the like. The worklists storage repository  **1408**  may further include a tasks library  **1412**  containing user generated and user editable tasks such that the tasks are editable using predefined control options which are custom defined for each different type of worklist template. For example, the control options for a questionnaire template may be different from control options of the care plan template. The tasks are configured to be imported in a select worklist template from among the worklist templates to generate the computer executable worklist such that the computer executable worklist for a specific type may include user specific or customized tasks as retrieved from the templates saved in the tasks library  **1412**. While the templates of the worklists and the tasks may be predefined but the fact that these are user editable and customizable allows these to be specified for each specific device such as the first device  **1502**  or the second device  **1504**  or the third device  **1506**  to execute the tasks within the interaction zone  **108**.

The section A further includes the memory circuit  **1406**  coupled with the processing circuit  **1402**  and storing the plurality of application programming interfaces (APIs)  **1404**  providing the stack of API layers. The API layers may include a system API  **1404**  a layer to allow communication with customer applications  **1516**. In some cases, the customer applications such as  **1518**  may have capabilities to call the system APIs  **1404**  a directly while in some cases, the customer applications such as  **1520**  may not have system API calling capabilities as shown in FIG. 15. The customer applications  **1516**  may reside at the first device  **1502** , the second device  **1504** , and the third device  **1506** , in an embodiment. In an embodiment, the customer applications  **1516**  may reside at distinct locations but not at the first device  **1502** , the second device  **1504** , and the third device  **1506**  such as shown in FIG. 16.

The API layers may further include a supplementary modular, reusable and variably configurable independent API layer  **1404**  b which can be stacked with the API layer stack within the ecosystem  **1300**  as a modular component to provide services such as secure authentication, data transfer, and data handling applications configured for interaction zone parameters signifying the triggering event comprising the spatial presence and weather-controlled event. The API layers may further include a business process modeling layer  **1404** d that unifies the worklists storage repository  **1408**  with the processing circuit  **1402**  to flexibly adapt to variations in the worklists storage repository  **1408**. The API layers may further include a data abstraction layer  **1404**  c for enabling communication between the processing circuit  **1402**  and various data stores.

The ecosystem  **1300**  may further include a file-based interaction system  **1414**  including a first component communicatively and operatively connected with the processing circuit  **1402**  and a second component communicatively and operatively coupled with the first device  **1502** , the second device  **1504** , and the third device  **1506**. The second component may include an installable agent to cause the customer applications without API capability to interact with the system APIs  **1404**  a indirectly through the first component and the second component, to collect information from the first device  **1502** , the second device  **1504** , and the third device  **1506** , and to interact with the worklists storage repository  **1408**.

The component B of the ecosystem  **1300**  includes a device operating region configured within or outside the interaction zone  **108**. However, it must be appreciated, that execution of a worklist task occurs at the future time occurrence when a triggering event is sensed. The device operating region includes the customer's applications without API capability  **1520** , the customer's applications with API capability  **1518** , a plurality of execution servers including the first execution server  **1508** , the second execution server  **1510** , and the third execution server  **1512** , a plurality of devices including the first device  **1502** , the second device  **1504** , and the third device  **1506**. The customer's applications (also referred to as device applications) with API capability  **1518**  can interact with the system APIs  **1404**  a directly to allow execution of the computer executable worklist and the tasks contained therein. The customer's applications without API capability  **1520**  interact with the system APIs  **1404**  a through the file-based interaction system  **1414**  to allow execution of the computer executable worklist and the tasks contained therein. The device operating region may further include sensors such as weather sensors  **1522**  and location sensors  **1524**.

The component C may include an electronic medical transactional system  **1602**  including or coupled to an electronic medical records database  **1604**. The electronic medical transactional system  **1602**  may be communicatively connected with the processing circuit  **1402**  and may store computer executable patient data files retrieved from disparate data sources. Each of the computer executable patient data files is associated with a first identification code that is indicative of a patient's identity, a second identification code that is indicative of a practitioner associated with the patient, a third identification code that is indicative of a set of tasks recommended for performance, in association with the patient, by the practitioner at the future time occurrence. The electronic medical transactional system  **1602**  collects real time and non-real time data from the disparate data sources. The real time data may be captured from such as electronic health records, browser applications and the like sources. The non-real time data may be captured from sources such as health information exchange sources, bio-informatics data sources, clinical data sources, pharmacy data sources and the like. The electronic medical transactional system  **1602**  may be configured to analyze the collected data, harmonize the data and perform a variety of processing and post processing activities before the processed data is served to the processing circuit  **1402**. Based on the data received by the processing circuit  **1402** , the processing circuit  **1402**  may design the computer executable worklist using the worklist templates and tasks templates so that the computer executable work list when executed at the future time occurrence causes particular steps to be performed as recommended through the electronic medical transactional system  **1602**. The electronic medical transactional system  **1602**  may include a memory device that stores transactional applications. The transactional applications can call the system APIs  **1404**  a so as to integrate transactional elements with the processing circuit  **1402**. This allows the processing circuit  **1402**  to display on a display unit various analytical and processing information related to the data obtained from the disparate sources by the electronic medical transactional system  **1602**. The processing circuit  **1402**  thereon can take an action to generate the computer executable worklist for execution at the future time occurrence based on occurrence of the triggering event in the interaction zone  **108**. The communication between the electronic medical transactional system  **1602**  and the processing circuit  **1402**  is enabled through an installable agent device configured to be installed at the electronic medical transactional system  **1602**  in an embodiment. In another embodiment, the communication between the electronic medical transactional system  **1602**  and the processing circuit  **1402**  is enabled through browser extensions without using the installable agent device.

The component C may further include other external sources of work lists  **1606**  from where the work list templates may be imported by the processing circuit  **1402**  to schedule tasks for execution by the devices across various distributed systems. Various components in the component C may communicate with the processing circuit  **1402**  and the work lists storage repository  **1408**  from externally through applications with API capabilities  **1518**  and applications without capabilities  **1520** , external web applications  **1608** , and external mobile applications  **1610**. The applications with API capability  **1518**  can directly call the system APIs  **1404**  a while the applications without API capabilities  **1520**  can interact with the file-based interaction system  **1414**  to call the system APIs  **1404**  _a._

In an embodiment, the ecosystem  **1300**  may provide a collaborative computer-implemented method for protocol documentation, automation, and compliance designed for a plurality of safety critical medical devices associated with patients through the worklists management system  **400**. The plurality of devices may be safety critical devices which may be associated with patients and may be used to collect and generate patient data. In an example, a protocol may be defined to be used as a shared baseline across the plurality of medical devices such that different tasks from the computer-executable worklist are performed and executed upon occurrence of the trigger event at the future time occurrence in view of guidelines maintained within the defined protocol. The protocol may be shared by the plurality of medical devices. The protocol may be used to manage definition, documentation, tracking, and analysis of the computer-executable tasks and procedures when the protocol (such as in the form of patient care plans etc as discussed earlier) is distributed across people, organizations, or systems or the plurality of medical devices. The protocol provides an enterprise-grade, integration-friendly solution which ensures that all processes, procedures, compliance requirements associated with well-defined protocols in an organization have been done in an intended sequence by required personnel or devices within a specified time period within the interaction zone. This allows the processes to be scalable, repeatable and provable.

In an example, the protocol may be defined for a specific patient as a patient treatment protocol indicative of the shared baseline across the plurality of medical devices associated with the patient. The protocol may be defined using an input from the electronic medical transactional system  **1602**. The list of computer executable tasks contained within the computer executable worklist may be received for automated execution in a defined protocol sequence by the plurality of execution servers  **1508** ,  **1510** , and  **1512**  within the interaction zone. In an embodiment, authorized practitioners or devices ( **1502** ,  **1504** , and  **1506** ) associated with them may be allowed to make modifications to the shared baseline protocol to adopt the shared baseline protocol for other patients with customized patient-centric variations. A report may be generated based on execution of the shared baseline protocol to identify tasks execution variations. The worklists management system  **400**  may be adopted to learn from the report to eliminate the variations over time arising from usage by different medical devices or different practitioners associated with the same patient while still maintaining flexibility to modify the shared baseline for different patients.

Further exemplary benefits of the work lists management system  **400**  and the ecosystem  **1300**  described above are provided hereafter without limitations.

Regulated Industries such as Healthcare, Life Sciences/BioTech and Medical Devices may be required to be process driven for various reasons such as patient safety and the like. Clinical enterprises may be challenged with defining processes (also called tasks, workflows, etc.) that are scalable, repeatable, and provable. Patient care plans may need to show evidence that required steps have been executed across multiple distributed systems such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs), lab equipment, digital pathology, imaging devices, or even manual procedures. Clinical organizations may use the system  **400**  to meet next generation demands of shared medical service organizations and other types of organizations. Current workflow and compliance tools are generally designed for single-organization use but the system  **400**  may be configured to automate protocol execution across clinical and other types of organizations.

The system  **400**  may allow complex care plans to be created and coordinated across complex distributed organizations that may be tied and coordinated at the patient level through a platform using Internet-savvy Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The system  **400**  may provide regulated industries with an enterprise-grade, integration-friendly solution that ensures that all processes, procedures, compliance requirements associated with well-defined protocols in an organization have been done in an intended sequence by required personnel within a specified time period. The system  **400**  may ensure not only automation of protocols but proof of compliance of those protocols.

The system  **400**  may allow patient care plans, medical device connectivity, lab coordination, and similar complex tasks to be executed systematically with the help of easy to use work lists that may be defined without programmers or engineers. The work lists, which may be designed to be created by clinical personnel, may also be used as patient survey questionnaires, clinical process verifiers, medical care plans, regulatory mandate checkers and the like. The work lists may be versatile as they may allow for comments to be added, notifications to be sent, screenshots and attachments to be added, and tasks to be generated and assigned to staff members across multiple organizational boundaries.

The system  **400**  may provide a simple, yet fool proof method of ensuring that the work lists are run and completed at planned times by providing an option for scheduling the work lists and sending out notifications, to both clinical staff and patients, and reminding users to run them at defined time. Instead of static protocol documents, the system  **400**  may allow dynamic protocol execution and automation. Automatic notifications may go out and next run automatically enforces compliance when a care plan step changes.

The system  **400**  may provide patients with chronic conditions an ability to manage their health from the comfort of their home using next generation monitoring and wearable systems. The patients may use any kind of care plan that they would want to subscribe to such as losing weight, stopping smoking, managing their diet, handling exercise plans etc. The care plan may be as simple as reading an instruction from a doctor and simply following it through a mobile device. Clinicians and patients may be total synchronized with their care plans. The work lists may also act as questionnaires helping doctors collect information from patients before administering their care plan. This information may help doctors determine the best method of treatment based on the patient's lifestyle, behavior and other conditions.

The system  **400**  may track detailed statistics on care plans, work lists, and protocol automation so that Six Sigma or other Lean-style process engineering techniques may be used to improve and optimize clinical operations by performing "big data" analytics. The system  **400**  may allow analysts to understand whether complex, multi-organizational distributed processes are safely being executed and, based on real-time data, optimize for cost savings, patient satisfaction, patient safety, or a myriad of other factors.

The care plans, work lists, protocols, processes, and procedures may be created to be packaged in modules. This may allow, for example, small hospitals to use procedures created and branded by clinics. Researchers may cite use of regimented care plans in their clinical trials or other documentation. The system  **400**  may help prevent overuse of tests and procedures in a medical setup and may ensure that hospitals follow well defined guidelines in order to administer care for patients. This may save patients from doing a lot of unwanted tests and going through procedures which may not be required in the first place.

A lot of care needs to be taken while writing prescriptions and administering them. Potential drug interactions and correct dosages may also be ensured so that a patient receives right care. The system  **400**  may allow this by ensuring that hospital staff writing and administering prescriptions follow carefully laid down guidelines while writing or administering them. The system  **400**  may also help pharmacists with dispensing medicines with the help of guidelines or rules ensuring that right drugs are dispensed to right patients.

Generally, most healthcare institutions have routine tasks that may be simple or complex, that are repeatedly done either everyday as part of their routine clinical workflow tasks, or as part of specific medical procedures, blood tests, scans, etc. The system  **400**  may capture these routine tasks into work lists that may easily be run by anyone. These kinds of easy to do worklists make it easy for clinical personnel to get their jobs done faster and correctly with little or no chances of error thereby increasing their productivity.

The system  **400**  may ensure implementation of simple and complex tasks which are routine to help them manage patients health. Before a patient visits a doctor, he may have to run through a series of steps that are part of his routine visit. For example, he may need to do a blood test, check his blood pressure, get a scan done etc. Some of these tasks may need to done in a particular order and some of these may need to be done after reading an instruction. These kinds of tasks may be difficult for patients to remember and get them done especially if they are aged. The system  **400**  may help patients by informing them of an upcoming doctor's visit and letting them know what tests are due and taking them through these tests one step at a time. Once a test is done, they can mark them as done. Their doctors or caregivers may also get a notification that a particular patient has done all the tests that they had asked them to do.

In an example, the system  **400**  may be networked with WIFI enabled light emitting diodes (LEDs). The LEDs may be designed and defined to operate within the interaction zone. The LEDs may include sensors that may monitor presence, entry or exit of a person and transmit signals to the processing circuit  **110**  or the work lists management systems  **400**. The LEDs may monitor movements and manage work lists accordingly and/or initiate triggering events for performance of tasks. The LEDs may be controlled through a mobile phone, smart phones, or any other remote control device. In an example, when a new file is uploaded in a folder or at a server, the processing circuit  **110**  may send a notification to a user or a group of participants to have the user or the group of participants run a set of tasks from a work list assigned to them.

Healthcare providers visit for example elderly patients for routine checkup, glucose monitoring, blood analysis blood pressure check etc. If there is something that a healthcare provider need from a patient but don't want it done all the time or make a special trip for it, the embodiments herein may let the healthcare provider setup a tasks list or work list and then establish a rule that next time based on some trigger action (e.g. entering the facility or going of a patient to home, or when patient arrives and checks in the hospital) or next time when this event happens at specific conditions, drive these actions. These actions may for example ask patient a question and then fill a form. The list of tasks may be completely arbitrary.

In an embodiment, the system  **400**  may provide multi-discipline, multi-stakeholder, multi-institution, executable specifications for distributed workflows based on the interaction zone and time. Multi-discipline may represent that doctors, nurses, engineers, maintenance works, and the like from a variety of disciplines may create and manage their worklists in an executable (machine readable) manner with the use of a special purpose processor. Multi-stakeholder may represent that various tasks in the executable worklists can be run on behalf of a variety of stakeholders such as patients, their caregivers, and others that may not be associated within a healthcare ecosystem. Multi-institution may represent that a single executable worklist may have tasks that may be run across multiple legal organizations without limits. The worklists may be created and run by distributed disciplines for distributed stakeholders across distributed organizations. The executable worklists which are highly distributed may be timed to run for specific interaction results.

The embodiments herein provide a machine-readable executable specification that drives the worklist or protocol or process or procedure and then allows multiple institutions, stakeholders, and disciplines to interact with the executable worklist to allow enormous amounts of computer processing, quality checking, and numerous other computable activities to occur in real-time with the use of a special purpose processor. Therefore, workflows or protocols and the like defined by the worklist may be automated in accordance with the embodiments herein.

The embodiments herein may be embodied as a computer program product configured to include a pre-configured set of instructions, which when performed, can result in actions as stated in conjunction with the methods described above. In an example, the pre-configured set of instructions can be stored on a tangible non-transitory computer readable medium or a program storage device. In an example, the tangible non-transitory computer readable medium can be configured to include the set of instructions, which when performed by a device, can cause the device to perform acts similar to the ones described here. Embodiments herein may also include tangible and/or non-transitory computer-readable storage media for carrying or having computer executable instructions or data structures stored thereon. Such non-transitory computer readable storage media can be any available media that can be accessed by a special purpose device, including the functional design of any special purpose processor as discussed above. By way of example, and not limitation, such non-transitory computer-readable media can include RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to carry or store desired program code means in the form of computer executable instructions, data structures, or processor chip design. When information is transferred or provided over a network or another communications connection (either hardwired, wireless, or combination thereof) to a computer, the computer properly views the connection as a computer-readable medium. Thus, any such connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of the computer-readable media.

Computer-executable instructions include, for example, instructions and data which cause a special purpose device to perform a certain function or group of functions. Computer-executable instructions also include program modules that are executed by computers in stand-alone or network environments. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, components, data structures, objects, and the functions inherent in the design of special-purpose devices, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Computer executable instructions, associated data structures, and program modules represent examples of the program code means for executing steps of the methods disclosed herein. The particular sequence of such executable instructions or associated data structures represents examples of corresponding acts for implementing the functions described in such steps.

In an exemplary embodiment, the various modules described herein and illustrated in the figures are embodied as hardware-enabled modules and may be configured as a plurality of overlapping or independent electronic circuits, devices, and discrete elements packaged onto a circuit board to provide data and signal processing functionality within a computer. An example might be a comparator, inverter, or flip-flop, which could include a plurality of transistors and other supporting devices and circuit elements. The modules that are configured with electronic circuits process computer logic instructions capable of providing digital and/or analog signals for performing various functions as described herein. The various functions can further be embodied and physically saved as any of data structures, data paths, data objects, data object models, object files, database components. For example, the data objects could be configured as a digital packet of structured data. The data structures could be configured as any of an array, tuple, map, union, variant, set, graph, tree, node, and an object, which be stored and retrieved by computer memory and may be managed by processors, compilers, and other computer hardware components. The data paths can be configured as part of a computer CPU that performs operations and calculations as instructed by the computer logic instructions. The data paths could include digital electronic circuits, multipliers, registers, and buses capable of performing data processing operations and arithmetic operations (e.g., Add, Subtract, etc.), bitwise logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, etc.), bit shift operations (e.g., arithmetic, logical, rotate, etc.), complex operations (e.g., using single clock calculations, sequential calculations, iterative calculations, etc.). The data objects may be configured as physical locations in computer memory and can be a variable, a data structure, or a function. In the embodiments configured as relational databases (e.g., such Oracle® relational databases), the data objects can be configured as a table or column. Other configurations include specialized objects, distributed objects, object oriented programming objects, and semantic web objects, for example. The data object models can be configured as an application programming interface for creating HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Extensible Markup Language (XML) electronic documents. The models can be further configured as any of a tree, graph, container, list, map, queue, set, stack, and variations thereof. The data object files are created by compilers and assemblers and contain generated binary code and data for a source file. The database components can include any of tables, indexes, views, stored procedures, and triggers.

The techniques provided by the embodiments herein may be implemented on an integrated circuit chip (not shown). The chip design is created in a graphical computer programming language, and stored in a computer storage medium (such as a disk, tape, physical hard drive, or virtual hard drive such as in a storage access network). If the designer does not fabricate chips or the photolithographic masks used to fabricate chips, the designer transmits the resulting design by physical means (e.g., by providing a copy of the storage medium storing the design) or electronically (e.g., through the Internet) to such entities, directly or indirectly. The stored design is then converted into the appropriate format (e.g., GDSII) for the fabrication of photolithographic masks, which typically include multiple copies of the chip design in question that are to be formed on a wafer. The photolithographic masks are utilized to define areas of the wafer (and/or the layers thereon) to be etched or otherwise processed.

The resulting integrated circuit chips can be distributed by the fabricator in raw wafer form (that is, as a single wafer that has multiple unpackaged chips), as a bare die, or in a packaged form. In the latter case the chip is mounted in a single chip package (such as a plastic carrier, with leads that are affixed to a motherboard or other higher level carrier) or in a multichip package (such as a ceramic carrier that has either or both surface interconnections or buried interconnections). In any case the chip is then integrated with other chips, discrete circuit elements, and/or other signal processing devices as part of either (a) an intermediate product, such as a motherboard, or (b) an end product. The end product can be any product that includes integrated circuit chips, ranging from toys and other low-end applications to advanced computer products having a display, a keyboard or other input device, and a central processor, and may be configured, for example, as a kiosk.

The embodiments herein can include both hardware and software elements. The embodiments that are implemented in software include but are not limited to, firmware, resident software, microcode, etc. Furthermore, the embodiments herein can take the form of a computer program product accessible from a computer-usable or computer-readable medium providing program code for use by or in connection with a computer or any instruction execution system. For the purposes of this description, a computer-usable or computer readable medium can be any apparatus that can comprise, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.

The medium can be an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system (or apparatus or device) or a propagation medium. Examples of a computer-readable medium include a semiconductor or solid state memory, magnetic tape, a removable computer diskette, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), a rigid magnetic disk and an optical disk. Current examples of optical disks include compact disk—read only memory (CD-ROM), compact disk—read/write (CD-R/W) and DVD.

A data processing system suitable for storing and/or executing program code will include at least one processor coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus. The memory elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code, bulk storage, and cache memories which provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution.

Input/output (I/O) devices (including but not limited to keyboards, displays, pointing devices, etc.) can be coupled to the system either directly or through intervening I/O controllers. Network adapters may also be coupled to the system to enable the data processing system to become coupled to other data processing systems or remote printers or storage devices through intervening private or public networks. Modems, cable modem and Ethernet cards are just a few of the currently available types of network adapters.
